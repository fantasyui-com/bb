                    pleasure, or fear of pain, by using one&#x2019;s mind to understand the world

        <p>Emperor Marcus Aurelius (161-180 AD) shows his clemency towards the
          vanquished after his success against Germanic tribes. Marcus Aurelius
          wrote a book titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations">Meditations</a> and today it is available as an <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Meditations-Audiobook/B004IBRMZS">Audiobook</a>.</p>

        <p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoe_Gozen">Tomoe</a> (c.
            1157 &#x2013; 1247) was especially beautiful, with white skin, long hair, and
            charming features. She was also a remarkably strong archer, and as a
            swordswoman she was a warrior worth a thousand, ready to confront a
            demon or a god, mounted or on foot. She handled unbroken horses with
            superb skill; she rode unscathed down perilous descents. Whenever a
            battle was imminent, Yoshinaka sent her out as his first captain,
            equipped with strong armor, an oversized sword, and a mighty bow; and
            she performed more deeds of valor than any of his other warriors.</em></p>

        <p>Where a Hunter had to be a hunter or perish, becoming a warrior was
          almost optional. A warrior needed training, skill and wisdom to survive
          into retirement. In my private opinion, a warrior also needed a tribe.
          Again, as not to live in isolation.</p>

        <p>It is in the wisdom of warriors that we find great inspiration and strength.</p>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitobe_Inaz%C5%8D">Nitobe Inaz&#x14D;</a> wrote:
          <em>A truly brave man is ever serene; he is never taken by surprise;
            nothing ruffles the equanimity of his spirit. In the heat of battle he
            remains cool; in the midst of catastrophes he keeps level his mind.
            Earthquakes do not shake him, he laughs at storms. We admire him as
            truly great, who, in the menacing presence of danger or death, retains
            his self-possession; who, for instance, can compose a poem under
            impending peril or hum a strain in the face of death. Such indulgence
            betraying no tremor in the writing or in the voice, is taken as an
            infallible index of a large nature - of what we call a capacious mind,
            which, far from being pressed or crowded, has always room for something
            more.</em></p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <p>In Eight virtues of Bushido we are reminded of the following:</p>

        <p><em>Righteousness</em>: Be acutely honest throughout your dealings
          with all people. Believe in justice, not from other people, but from
          yourself. To the true warrior, all points of view are deeply considered
          regarding honesty, justice and integrity. Warriors make a full
          commitment to their decisions.</p>

        <p><em>Heroic Courage</em>: Hiding like a turtle in a shell is not
          living at all. A true warrior must have heroic courage. It is absolutely
          risky. It is living life completely, fully and wonderfully. Heroic
          courage is not blind. It is intelligent and strong.</p>

        <p><em>Benevolence, Compassion</em>: Through intense training and hard
          work the true warrior becomes quick and strong. They are not as most
          people. They develop a power that must be used for good. They have
          compassion. They help their fellow men at every opportunity. If an
          opportunity does not arise, they go out of their way to find one.</p>

        <p><em>Respect</em>: True warriors have no reason to be cruel. They do
          not need to prove their strength. Warriors are not only respected for
          their strength in battle, but also by their dealings with others. The
          true strength of a warrior becomes apparent during difficult times.</p>

        <p><em>Integrity</em>: When warriors say that they will perform an
          action, it is as good as done. Nothing will stop them from completing
          what they say they will do. They do not have to &#x2018;give their word&#x2019;. They
          do not have to &#x2018;promise&#x2019;. Speaking and doing are the same action.</p>

        <p><em>Honour</em>: Warriors have only one judge of honor and character,
          and this is themselves. Decisions they make and how these decisions are
          carried out are a reflection of whom they truly are. You cannot hide
          from yourself.</p>

        <p><em>Duty and Loyalty</em>: Warriors are responsible for everything
          that they have done and everything that they have said, and all of the
          consequences that follow. They are immensely loyal to all of those in
          their care. To everyone that they are responsible for, they remain
          fiercely true.</p>

        <p><em>Self-Control</em>: Warriors feel more than others. This calmness
          of behavior and composure of mind is rooted in the choice of endurance
          without a groan, wisdom over ignorance, understanding over
          confrontation, love over anger, and unbreakability in the face of
          suffering and loneliness.</p>

        <p>I don&#x2019;t understand why bloody battles are necessary. I don&#x2019;t think
          anybody has ever understood that. I think we can learn a great deal from
          Bryan Stevenson&#x2019;s words <em>&#x201C;Our humanity depends on everyone&#x2019;s humanity.&#x201D;</em></p>

        <p><img class="img-fluid" src="images/lady.png" alt></p>

        <p>I think there was a hope that hard earned ideas won in hell of war
          would spread to no end in time. That, Knightly Vitues, Chivalry,
          Bushido, Stoicism, would grab a hold of Humanity and never let go, would
          never stop making us better and wiser. But even a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">meme</a> has limitations, the gaps in schooling will end propagation of the most viral lessons, and poverty will return&#x2026;</p>

        <p>Poverty. Poverty, Never Changes.</p>

        <p>Police in Chicago are calling for tougher sentencing, the gangs are
          saying &#x201C;I have kids, I need to put food on the table&#x201D;. And one of the
          lessons we learn from this text is that &#x201C;A human being is more than the
          worst thing they have ever done.&#x201D;</p>

        <p>My friends, my heroes. The situation is only hopeless when we stand
          on the very bottom. When we rise, when we rise onto the shoulders of
          giants, things change.</p>

        <p>The Hopelessness of Poverty becomes transformed into a Hope. It
          becomes yet another mission, a new challenge. It becomes a source of
          wisdom, a source of Great Power.</p>
