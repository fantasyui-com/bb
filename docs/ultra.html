        <p><em>I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.</em></p>

        <p>Bruce Lee, was the first Ultra that I have heard of. Ultras are folks
          like you and I that train to jump a little seedling of corn. Day by
          day, GRADUALLY, the little corn grows a little bit taller, and the
          little ultra strives to jump a little bit higher.</p>

        <p>In modern times the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C25K">C25K</a> comes to mind, I invite you all to meet The <a href="http://carlifierce.com/10-k-downloads/">Fierce Carli</a>
          Just from plain experience with jogging we can guesstimate that by
          GRADUALLY increasing the length of distance, we will gain the endurance
          to run hundreds of miles.</p>

        <p>&#x201C;The human body has limitations. The human spirit is boundless.&#x201D;, &#x201C;The finish line, is a pine box.&#x201D;</p>

        <p>Dean Karnazes, mentions Lactic Acid build up. I think of it as mostly
          nonsense, where does the lactic acid go when your performance increases
          from long distance running? Your first mile the first time you run will
          burn, but the 10,000th time you will feel elation.</p>

        <p>Here is Dean&#x2019;s book, it is a good read: <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Ultramarathon-Man-Audiobook/B002VA3GIU">Ultramarathon Man</a></p>

        <p>Pain, is just a chemical signal, it is a squirt of goo &#x2013; pain my dear friends, does not hurt.</p>

        <p>It is when you stop, and all time scrolls by you, that really hurts.
          This is why I write to the youngest of you, one of the greatest
          Storytellers of all generations once discovered a great wish that we all
          wish for eventually:</p>

        <p></p><div class="widget youtube" data-id="wxmRulRQsLc" data-title="Make me young again">
      <div class="card text-white bg-dark shadow">
        <div class="card-header">
          Make me young again
        </div>
        <div class="card-video">
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmRulRQsLc"><img class="card-img-bottom" src="images/youtube-wxmRulRQsLc.jpg" alt="Make me young again"></a>
          <img class="video-play" src="images/video-play.png">
        </div>


      </div>
    </div><p></p>



        <p>&#x201C;Make me young again&#x201D; - but you are young now, you can make most of
          it, no wax, because it is all ahead of you. Go, close your eyes and
          connect with your 80 year old self, and make the wish Killgore Trout
          did: &#x201C;Make Me Young Again&#x201D;, and open your eyes, and be young but wiser
          for it. Therein you will discover the nature of the Ultra. While we live
          our only life, poetically we live as it was countless lives already. By
          wiggling forward and back we can see where we are headed, and end up
          where we always wished to be.</p>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>
          is asking you to review your decisions, treat them with more gravity,
          &#x201C;Would you be willing to relive your life again, and again, and again?
          Or would you prefer to stay dead and if so, then you need to review your
          decision making.&#x201D;:</p>

        <p><em>The heaviest burden: What, if some day or night, a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you:</em></p>

        <p><em>This life, as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to
            live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing
            new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh&#x2026; must
            return to you&#x2014;all in the same succession and sequence&#x2014;even this spider
            and this moonlight between the trees and even this moment and I myself.
            The eternal hourglass of existence is turned over again and again&#x2014;and
            you with it, speck of dust!</em></p>

        <p><em>Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse
            the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous
            moment when you would have answered him: &#x201C;You are a god, and never have I
            heard anything more divine!&#x201D;</em></p>

        <p><em>If this thought were to gain possession of you, it would change
            you as you are, or perhaps crush you. The question in each and every
            thing, &#x201C;do you want this once more and innumerable times more?&#x201D; would
            lie upon your actions as the greatest weight.</em></p>

        <p>Make no mistakes, my friends. The workout is powered by the soul, of a
          very old warrior, who lived many a lifetime in daydreams, stories,
          books, and poems. There is no pain, it is just a signal.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <p>On the Mind part, focus on gaining wisdom by all means. On the body
          part, keep extending your endurance, the pain is too primitive to catch
          up with an ultra.</p>
