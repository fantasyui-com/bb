                                  We knew there was no conspiracy, no deliberate ill intent, no plan to betray a student for a paycheck.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Many of the teachers were our friends, family, people we admired.
                                  Many felt bad about the level of education we were receiving.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  But, whether they liked it or not,
                                  consciously or subconsciously,
                                  at the end of the day,
                                  it was clear that the teachers were forcing us to memorize for long enough to pass standardized testing,
                                  and the administration didn&apos;t have a problem with that.

                                  They meant no harm,
                                  they did it so that they could get paid,
                                  so that the school could get funding,
                                  so that everyone would keep their job.

                                  But those who didn&apos;t rise against it caused harm.
                                  They interfered with our real education, harming creativity, erasing individuality.

                                  In K-12 they taught us that delicate hearts belonged with mommy at home, that bullies were a fact, and life is never fair.
                                  They hurt our hearts, and shamed us by saying. &quot;Oh, just grow up, already! Because, you need to improve your grades.&quot;

                                  &quot;Today, we&apos;ll get it all working, and today we&apos;ll get paid.
                                  Tomorrow, tomorrow, when everything is worked-out and working,
                                  we&apos;ll get to the students - one thing at a time.&quot; - They&apos;d say.

                                <p>
                                  But we knew that tomorrow never comes, once the new day starts, it is already today.
                                  The tomorrow they thought of, was more of a garbage can for nice-to-haves.
                                </p>

                                  They were working very hard, and it was all very hard work.
                                  But they didn&apos;t have the strength to do both, their job, and make schools work.
                                </p>

                                  In effect, everyone forgot about us.
                                  They forgot we were the point and the future.
                                  Their aim was no longer our education,
                                  but merely staying in business by arranging for what in effect became, an impression of one.
                                </p>

                                  To accomplish all this, some changes needed to be made,
                                  they first convinced themselves that they were doing a great job so as long as they were working hard,
                                  and then some things needed to be taken away,
                                  and a few needed to be twisted around.

                                  We were forced to recognize that teachers work really, really hard,
                                  that the administration works very hard, it is all hard work, extremely stressful.
                                  People give up days off, cancel vacations, make sacrifices.

                                  To question administration or teachers while they work that hard,
                                  makes for a heartless, cruel, shameful petty little student.
                                  Should she rise, she&apos;ll be made an example of by means of shame, or cruelty, or some other administrative pettiness.

                                  Void of context, many of the shallow arguments the teachers made could almost stand up to a proper dialogue.
                                  But teaching is not just a job,
                                  it is not an ordinary job,
                                  and it is not about mere transfer of knowledge.

                                  In context of Education, failing to educate, parading those who want to breeze through with a 4.0 GPA to get the hell out and move on and calling them Educated ... is an insult, utter nonsense, fraud.
                                  The teachers were supposed to work for us first, and only then would they be rewarded.

                                  We were taught that genius is rare,
                                  that creativity is reserved for those who have talent,
                                  that good grades get a good job,
                                  that only the smart ace the tests,
                                  and that to pass a test we need to cram harder and take more notes,
                                  that grade-point-average is the measure of a human - because that is how the world works.

                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  And work... &quot;Work would set us free.&quot;
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  We were scared, because there was no road ahead.
                                  There was no clear authentic future.
                                  Not without that same charade, that inauthenticity,
                                  that glass of fashion, that mold of form
                                  that we were being pressed into,
                                  and everyone else already participated in.

                                  We thought we were the losers. We had the grades to prove it.
                                  We formed a club.
                                  We sarcastically called it The Breakfast Club after an old movie.
                                  We expected to be held back, and eventually kicked out.
                                  We didn&apos;t expect to be seen as the gifted ones.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  The others secretly saw us as courageous, strong and unbreakable, healthy and authentic.
                                  But, the other kids didn&apos;t really know how to relate to us.
                                  We were the same but they were too confused by the noise of homework, quizzes, tests, and grades, chores, parents and daily circles.

                                    they were the first to shine,
                                    the mightiest of the thinkers,
                                    the best of the survivors.

                                    Already forged in battle at home, the betrayal of schooling was the tipping point for many.

                                    the teachers were supposed to kindle their flame,
                                    but they filled their vessel and often extirpated their spark.

                                  Someone said that the only reason the teachers seemed to know more than we did,
                                  was because they had to regurgitate that same stuff every year to keep their jobs...
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Each time it came up;
                                  there was always someone to say that they wanted to help us,
                                  but in the end they seemed to have wanted to assimilate and destroy, embrace and extinguish... get the gifted ones out of the system to make things easier for themselves, to calm the waters...
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Nobody, really, took grades seriously because of how easy it was to cram before a test, pass it, and forget it.
                                  Since tests did not represent student knowledge, grades did not represent the student.
                                  Everyone knew this, nobody said anything because once the students realized the school was mostly a charade they just wanted to graduate and move on.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Teachers didn&apos;t want to change anything because they didn&apos;t want to make their job any harder, they just want to get paid and go home.
                                  Management was focused on grade points and funding.
                                  Everybody else was parading solutions, but there was no time,
                                  any extras were aimed at symptoms,
                                  extras just added to the weight of existing problems.
                                  The root cause was that we were not learning.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  The threat of repeating classes, reliving the same noise, or being held back was exactly like prison.

                                  There was a problem with how Investors viewed people who paraded their GPA or even completed schools.
                                  The Investors didn&apos;t want followers, and above all they didn&apos;t want cheaters that tried to pass their GPA as something authentic or even meaningful.
                                  The Investors sought Natural Born Leaders, they sought Evidence of Exceptional Ability.
                                  The Investors sought people who rejected the inauthenticity of broken education and didn&apos;t partake in stupid charades.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  At this point everybody viewed school as a puppet show for parents to have one thing less to worry about during the day. Grades were seen a way to pacify them, it was all nonsense.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Staying in school had a negative impact on our education, on our futures.
                                  College and Premed brought sleep deprivation into the farce, it was a dangerous joke.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  In the end all we had was our friendship. The school was tearing us apart, the Start-ups kept us together.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Looking back at how young we were, how unbreakable, how fierce.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Though we didn&apos;t believe in schools, we doubted ourselves for years.
                                  Now, looking back, we searched for mentors, but none were to be found.
                                  But, in the absence of teachers, we became the teachers.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  To quote an old commercial: We were The Crazy Ones, The Misfits, The Rebels, The Troublemakers,
                                  the round pegs in the square holes,
                                  the ones who saw things differently,
                                  who were not fond of rules,
                                  and had no respect for the status quo.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  We were the ones crazy enough to think we could change the world...
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  ... and we did ...
