            &quot;... it was clear that the teachers were forcing us to memorize for long enough to pass standardized testing,
            so that they could get paid,
            so that the school could get funding,
            so that everyone would keep their jobs...&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;We formed a club, back in High School. We sarcastically called it The Breakfast Club, we though we were the losers.
            We expected to be held back, and eventually kicked out. We didn&apos;t expect to be seen as the gifted ones.&quot;

          <p>
            &quot;Someone said that the only reason the teachers seemed to know more than we did, was because they had to regurgitate that same shit every year to keep their jobs...&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Each time it came up; there was always someone to say that they wanted to help us, but in the end they seemed to have wanted to assimilate and destroy... get the gifted ones out of the system to make things easier for themselves...&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;There was a problem with how Investors viewed people who paraded their GPA or even completed schools. They didn&apos;t want followers, quite the contrary, they sought Natural Born Leaders.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;... at this point everybody viewed school as a puppet show for parents to have one thing less to worry about during the day... and grades were seen a way to pacify parents, it was all nonsense ...&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;... Staying in school had a negative impact on our education, on our futures. College and Premed brought sleep deprivation into the farce, it was a dangerous joke.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;... In the end all we had was our friendship. The school was tearing us apart, the Start-ups kept us together...&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            Looking back at how young we were, how unbreakable, how fierce...
          </p>

          <p>
            Though we didn&apos;t believe in schools, we doubted ourselves for years.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, looking back, we searched for mentors, but none were to be found.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the absence of teachers, we became the teachers.
          </p>

          <p>
            To quote an an old commercial: We were Crazy Ones, The Misfits, The Rebels, The Troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes,
            the ones who saw things differently, who were not fond of rules, and had no respect for the status quo.
          </p>

          <p>
            We were the ones crazy enough to think we could change the world...
          </p>

          <p>
            ... and we did &#x2764;
          </p>
