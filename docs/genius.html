            Genius, is a collector, and a master of frameworks.

            The &quot;Double U&quot;, the 26 unsqiglies (as I call them - my original alphabet has extra squiggly letters I never knew what to do with). And then the comma and, Oxford Comma, the mysterious semicolon, the haunting tilde?
          </p>

          <p>Rhymes.</p>
          <p>Poems.</p>

          <p>Letters.</p>

          <p>
            Transcribing Lyrics, of a song that paused your time, classes, grades, parents?

          <p>
            Memorizing Poems?

            Some things you think are one-way today (High School, Roswell, Globalization, Content of Character, Memorable Words, Superstars, and/or Reptilians) will change meaning, as you grow; possibly/hopefully even reverse.

            Easy On-boarding means easy access to eventual mastery. It means progressive, gradual learning and mastery.
          </p>

          <p>
            It would be difficult, though not impossible, to learn to write words without knowing the alphabet.
            English, or as I call it here &quot;The English Framework for Advanced Human to Human Communication&quot; bonds really well with our ability to learn words as a baby.
            The language evolved with human learning abilities. If English words were presented without letters, it would still be a functional, but very different language.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fundamentally, a framework without easy on-boarding, or progressive adaptation features is kind of useless.
            If there is no way to learn something, it won&apos;t be learned.

            Memorization of &#x3C0;r2 should be a crime. That is the same as being threatened to learn English words without using the alphabet.

            Some young lady out there, tears in eyes can&apos;t comprehend &#x3C0;r2, and her mind rejects memorization, she NEEDS to know - tears in eyes - why is the r is squared? Her mind reaching for why is the r multiplied by it self. Is there a geometric square somehow?

            Just call them infinite. Because with enough divisions you can already see, with your own eyes, that the base of the rectangle is half the circumference of the circle.
