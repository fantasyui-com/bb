            Genius, is a collector, and a master of frameworks.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of the most pop frameworks, is English. Or as we will call it here: The English Framework for Advanced Human to Human Communication.
          </p>

          <p>
            The &quot;Double U&quot;, the 26 unsqiglies (as I call them - my original alphabet has extra squiggly letters I never knew what to do with). And then the comma and, Oxford Comma, the mysterious semicolon, the haunting tilde?
          </p>

          <p>Rhymes.</p>
          <p>Poems.</p>
          <p>Songs.</p>
          <p>Letters.</p>
          <p>Essays.</p>

          <p>
            Transcribing Lyrics, of a song that paused your time, classes, grades, parents?
          </p>

          <p>
            Memorizing Poems?
          </p>

          <p>
            Quotes? To thine own... yeah you did.
          </p>

          <p>
            Speaking. Reading. Writing.

              Once you have the framework down, you gain special abilities, like Storytelling, for example.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can warp facts to construct fantasies based on real events and beings, now transformed into Mighty Ice Giants, maybe Dragons, Lost Worlds, and Faster Than Light Travel.
            </p>
          <p>
            You can encode a lifetime of experience in an exciting story with enchanted objects, and transcendental superhero journeys, here you can easily pass on a message across centuries.
            You can leave stones unturned that will mark forks and joins that will call to others to add to your story, to keep it alive across centuries even as English evolves.

            My friends, the story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grendel%27s_mother" title="Grendel&apos;s Mother">Grendles M&#x14D;dor</a> remains unfinished,

            Was the Dragon a mere reminder,
            a clumsy blurb for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori">Memento Mori</a>
            or is that just the introduction to the real story,
            the story that has little to do with men like Beowulf who can&apos;t even take down a fat flying lizard right.

            A story burned to the ground by the spirit of the age,
            the Greatest Story Never Told, The Story of The Ides of the Old World.

            Because storytelling, inspiration, sharing of wisdom, is just a part of The English Framework for Human Communication - that you mastered without noticing... as a child.

          <p>
            At the age of 15 or earlier, you master a framework almost as complex as any of the more interesting Daughters of Philosophy (The Sciences).

    <div class="card-header lead font-weight-bold">Good Frameworks come with Easy On-boarding</div>

      <div class="card-body">
        <div class="py-2 lead">
        

          <p>
            Easy On-boarding means easy access to eventual mastery. It means progressive, gradual learning and mastery.
          </p>

          <p>
            It would be difficult, though not impossible, to learn to write words without knowing the alphabet.
            English, or as I call it here &quot;The English Framework for Advanced Human to Human Communication&quot; bonds really well with our ability to learn words as a baby.
            The language evolved with human learning abilities. If English words were presented without letters, it would still be a functional, but very different language.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fundamentally, a framework without easy on-boarding, or progressive adaptation features is kind of useless.
            If there is no way to learn something, it won&apos;t be learned.

          </p>

          <p>
            But overall, new on-boarding can be tacked on to something that previously had trouble with it.
            For example in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Created_the_Integers">God Created the Integers: The Mathematical Breakthroughs That Changed History</a> Stephen Hawking helped his memory by creating a history of evolution of mathematical thinking.
            I view the book as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci">Memory Palace</a> with emphasis on historical dates and progression, that expands standard mathematical on-boarding and helps the reader to a greater initial spectrum of Mathematics.

            Do you remember memorizing &#x3C0;r&#xB2;?
          </p>

          <p>
            Forcing memorization of &#x3C0;r&#xB2; or any formula,
            should be seen as psychological torture, means of intimidation.
            It should be seen as cause for suspension of the teacher, and review and repair of the damage they made.
          </p>

          <p>
            Formula memorization is the same as being forced to learn English without the use of alphabet. It is incredibly cruel.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some young lady out there, tears in eyes can&apos;t comprehend &#x3C0;r&#xB2;, and her mind rejects memorization, she NEEDS to know - tears in eyes - why is the r is squared? Her mind reaching for why is the r multiplied by it self. Is there a geometric square somehow?
          </p>

          <p>
            Warm, but not warm enough.
          </p>

          <p>
            A brilliant mind yearning for arriving at the formula herself, yet forced to merely blindly accepting it, or repeating the whole year.
          </p>

          <p>
            People who need to invent the formulas, people who have the natural predisposition for abstract theoretical mathematics... The naturally predisposed for abstract mechanics or Mathematics, are being forced, not to, learn Mathematics, or be punished.

          Just witness that half the circumference of the circle (4 slices) are used at the the base of the rectangle, because the other four are used up top.

          It really does not matter how many divisions of the circle so as long as reaching infinity makes for an infinitely perfect rectangle &#x2764;

        <div class="widget text" data-title="Math">
    <div class="card text-white bg-danger shadow">

    <div class="card-header lead font-weight-bold">Math</div>

      <div class="card-body">
        <div class="py-2 lead">
        

          <p>
            Math is almost too easy to bother with, it is certainly too messy when compared to the exquisite and wonderfully unambiguous and vast world of programming.
          </p>

          <p>
            Basic programming is enough to visualize all the important things in mathematics.
          </p>

          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">Math as Code</a>
          </p>

          <p>
            It was only ever intimidating because it is a primitive language meant for paper and pencil, with an ugly problem to boot.
            As <a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">Math as Code</a> notes &quot;Mathematical symbols can mean different things depending on the author, context and the field of study (linear algebra, set theory, etc).&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            It can be a wonderful and enlightening adventure to visit works of Newton from the simple world of programming, but to teach Calculus on paper is to waste your time on trivialities of a simple loop.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let us face that today&apos;s &quot;Alphabet of Math&quot; is basic Programming.
            This is because programming notation is not as ambiguous,
            and it is easier to latch-on-to-and-pursue mathematical concepts,
            as trivial as they will turn out to be to you now.
          </p>

          <p>
            As an enormous bonus, at the end of the day you can see your new knowledge come to life with a simple,
            mathematically themed program like <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/">P5js</a> or maybe <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a>, or even <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">SVG</a> (keep it in sync with leading Web Technologies as they receive most attention and thus good programming, exposure, use, and as a bonus bring a solid measure of fair employment opportunities).
          </p>

          <p>
            Some are moved by Ides, others by Numbers. As numbers can now come to life when transitioning from dead paper to colorful screens, games, visualizations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Look a the ease with which Karlie Kloss teaches real, live, moving, interactive, Modern Math to children.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is not just Drag and Drop programming, with works like <a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">Math as Code</a> children who enjoy it, get access to Theoretical Physics and Abstract Mathematics. A child using the program that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language">Karlie teaches with</a> will see little surface difference between making a rectangle and converting matter to energy via Einstein&apos;s E=mc&#xB2;.
            A venture into the function contents, which are not too complex as shown in the previous video, may perhaps create a new Einstein, change the World, or Time, or better yet, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light">both</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this short clip she interjects the use of variables and dynamic calculation; as a result she creates a reusable function that creates rectangles with a base twice the height.
          </p>

          <p>
            For many this is a mind blowing lesson that will call to them, pull them into the world of Math, Computers, Science, Technology.
          </p>

          <p>
            <a href="https://www.kodewithklossy.com/">Kode With Klossy</a> shows what these classes are like. What real education looks like, where teachers strive to be worthy of teaching their students.

        <div class="py-2 lead">
        

          <p>
            Tell your teacher that memorization is over, it is useless to you.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tell your teachers that they are not allowed to stand in your way of real knowledge.
          </p>

          <p>
            They are interrupting your real education by threatening to mark you down for not following their worthless directions
            which can only lead to memorization, which in turn will soon result in you forgetting what you force-remembered.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is not possible to retain long-term what you memorized in the way you did it.
            If that is what they expect of you, then you maybe being taken advantage of.
            The motive is teacher getting paid, and ultimately, school qualifying for more funding.
          </p>


          <p>
            GPA or not, you still need those Marvelous Frameworks;
            or people will easily mislead you.

            One example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_hesitancy">Vaccine Hesitancy</a> which a lot of people fall for,
            but there are more complicated and closer calls like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion">CFCs</a> and
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE2uwBA3EAw">Tetraethyl Lead</a>,
            and now <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22116696">PFAS</a>.

            You need to be knowledgeable enough to foresee consequences of what is going on in the world.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your life depends on it. The future of this planet depends on You, don&apos;t count on the adults, they&apos;re all going to retire of old age soon enough.

          </p>

          <p>
            Your life depends on real education, your knowledge has impact on everything from internal decision making, to external politics of the whole World.
          </p>

          <p>
            The teacher will soon retire, feel great about all the great work, and you will become the future.
          </p>

          <p>
            Just, take it upon yourselves to learn on your own, it is safer this way.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can stay in school, learn in library and from audio books.
          </p>

          <p>
              Real knowledge will always beat what you memorized and forgot.

            On the other end, people saying they are better than you because they are a Genius, are sick from poverty of mind, they got fractured, stuck.
