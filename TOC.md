# Warrior
A warrior is she that thrives where'er she be.

Bodybuilding is a side-effect of something more. Like Confidence, or Happiness, or Success, it will ensue from pursuit of things that seem just out of your reach.

*"Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win."* - Sun Tzu

[Viktor E. Frankl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Frankl) wrote,
*"Don't aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long-run—in the long-run, I say! — success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think about it"*

Warrior is the oldest name for it. Since our time in Africa we have progressed forward, and the word has changed many times. At each stage there are strong lessons to be learned, directly, or indirectly.

Whatever your calling, wherever you break away to make your stand, even if you fail to reach the top of your mountain, know that you will surely reach the rays of the sun, know that you will become part of the Great Family of Heroes, know that countless many will follow, and that your footsteps will become a well worn path, in time.

The lessons come from Thinkers, Soldiers, Presidents, Athletes, Mercenaries, Murphy's Law, Mighty Little Girls & Young Ladies, Mothers, Sisters, Brothers, and Fathers. From empathy and compassion, joy and tragedy, triumph and disaster, and great challenges like learning to live and grieve at the same time, or standing with the demonized, disposable, or voiceless.

The lessons come from, Choosing Life.

To progress forward, we must be ready to learn to understand by subtle analogy from all other theories. Theories of survival, of living above the common levels of life, of choosing heroism, choosing greatness. Striving to thrive, rising to impossible challenges, learning to overcome pain and suffering, and standing upon the shoulders of giants to lead the way for others to follow.

Kosmos, by Walt Whitman.

Who includes diversity and is Nature,<br>
Who is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of the earth, and the great charity of the earth and the equilibrium also,<br>
Who has not look’d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing, or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing,<br>
Who contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover,<br>
Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism, spiritualism, and of the æsthetic or intellectual,<br>
Who having consider’d the body finds all its organs and parts good,<br>
Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by subtle analogies all other theories,<br>
The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;<br>
Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in other globes with their suns and moons,<br>

Who, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day but for all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,<br>
The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together.<br>
