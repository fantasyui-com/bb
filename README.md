# Warrior
A warrior is she that thrives where'er she be.

Bodybuilding is a side-effect of something more. Like Confidence, or Happiness, or Success, it will ensue from pursuit of things that seem just out of your reach.

*"Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win."* - Sun Tzu

[Viktor E. Frankl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Frankl) wrote,
*"Don't aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long-run—in the long-run, I say! — success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think about it"*

Warrior is the oldest name for it. Since our time in Africa we have progressed forward, and the word has changed many times. At each stage there are strong lessons to be learned, directly, or indirectly.

Whatever your calling, wherever you break away to make your stand, even if you fail to reach the top of your mountain, know that you will surely reach the rays of the sun, know that you will become part of the Great Family of Heroes, know that countless many will follow, and that your footsteps will become a well worn path, in time.

The lessons come from Thinkers, Soldiers, Presidents, Athletes, Mercenaries, Murphy's Law, Mighty Little Girls & Young Ladies, Mothers, Sisters, Brothers, and Fathers. From empathy and compassion, joy and tragedy, triumph and disaster, and great challenges like learning to live and grieve at the same time, or standing with the demonized, disposable, or voiceless.

The lessons come from, Choosing Life.

To progress forward, we must be ready to learn to understand by subtle analogy from all other theories. Theories of survival, of living above the common levels of life, of choosing heroism, choosing greatness. Striving to thrive, rising to impossible challenges, learning to overcome pain and suffering, and standing upon the shoulders of giants to lead the way for others to follow.

Kosmos, by Walt Whitman.

Who includes diversity and is Nature,<br>
Who is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of the earth, and the great charity of the earth and the equilibrium also,<br>
Who has not look’d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing, or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing,<br>
Who contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover,<br>
Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism, spiritualism, and of the æsthetic or intellectual,<br>
Who having consider’d the body finds all its organs and parts good,<br>
Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by subtle analogies all other theories,<br>
The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;<br>
Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in other globes with their suns and moons,<br>

Who, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day but for all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,<br>
The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together.<br>

## Hunter

![](images/bears.jpg)

This artwork has been with me for as long as I can remember, I found it in a book entitled "Wszechświat życie człowiek" (Universe, Life, Human) and one of my favorite writers Bill Bryson wrote something just as good [A Short History of Nearly Everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything) which is available as an [Audiobook](https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Short-History-of-Nearly-Everything-Audiobook/B002V0KFPW) where he gently talks about learning, and what he learned about our universe.

From this simple image we can infer some really important facts about who we are, where we belong, the diet we evolved alongside with.

It is worth mentioning that before big rocks, and spears, we would chase animals to death in an act called [Endurance Hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_hunting)

Just from this overview alone, you get the picture of how capable we are, how noble, how unbreakable, how magnificent.

We belong in communities, not to live in isolation.

We did not store fat, we were lean, and we knew hunger well.

We are hunters, not for sport, but for survival.

We have superior cooling, superior intelligence, and we did well hunting without spears.

We ate fruit, vegetable, meat; that's out optimal diet, the nutrients that we evolved to require for our optimal health.

We grew up protecting each other, casting out those who stand in the way of future generations, looking after the little ones so that they may grow to become great hunters.

We are part of Nature, part of Planet Earth, we depend on it for our health and [Survival](https://youtu.be/TMrtLsQbaok)

## The Adventurer

In moving. In endless horizons, and mountains, and the sea; we learn to break away, and find our own paths. And there is a slope to each adventure that follows, and the adventurer knows that slope must increase, and the challenges must grow also.

*"Strength does not reside in having never been broken, but in the courage required to grow strong in the broken places"* - Kristen Jongen

"To die having made Something more equal to the centuries
Than muscle and bone, is mostly to shed weakness" - From Wise Men In Their Bad Hours by Robinson Jeffers.

Our search for wisdom, as well as our climb onto the shoulders of giants, is just the first part of our story. When we learn to push ourselves to travel the hardest slopes, our shoulders will become strong enough to holdup the countless adventurers that are sure to follow. Long after we depart, our hard earned wisdom will retain the momentum of our hardest slopes, to serve as an inextinguishable candle in the dark.

## Warrior of Duty and Loyalty

![](images/zeno-of-citium.jpg)

Zeno was the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy, which he taught in Athens from about 300 BC. Based on the moral ideas of the Cynics, Stoicism laid great emphasis on goodness and peace of mind gained from living a life of Virtue in accordance with Nature.

According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to eudaimonia (happiness) for humans is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not allowing oneself to be controlled by whim, the desire for pleasure, or fear of pain, by using one's mind to understand the world and to do one's part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and justly.

This simple Philosophy would have influenced the Roman Warrior.

![](images/marcus-aurelius.jpg)

Emperor Marcus Aurelius (161-180 AD) shows his clemency towards the vanquished after his success against Germanic tribes. Marcus Aurelius wrote a book titled [Meditations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations) and today it is available as an [Audiobook](https://www.audible.com/pd/Meditations-Audiobook/B004IBRMZS).

![](images/tomoe-gozen.jpg)

*[Tomoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoe_Gozen) (c. 1157 – 1247) was especially beautiful, with white skin, long hair, and charming features. She was also a remarkably strong archer, and as a swordswoman she was a warrior worth a thousand, ready to confront a demon or a god, mounted or on foot. She handled unbroken horses with superb skill; she rode unscathed down perilous descents. Whenever a battle was imminent, Yoshinaka sent her out as his first captain, equipped with strong armor, an oversized sword, and a mighty bow; and she performed more deeds of valor than any of his other warriors.*

Where a Hunter had to be a hunter or perish, becoming a warrior was almost optional. A warrior needed training, skill and wisdom to survive into retirement. In my private opinion, a warrior also needed a tribe. Again, as not to live in isolation.

It is in the wisdom of warriors that we find great inspiration and strength.

[Nitobe Inazō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitobe_Inaz%C5%8D) wrote:
*A truly brave man is ever serene; he is never taken by surprise; nothing ruffles the equanimity of his spirit. In the heat of battle he remains cool; in the midst of catastrophes he keeps level his mind. Earthquakes do not shake him, he laughs at storms. We admire him as truly great, who, in the menacing presence of danger or death, retains his self-possession; who, for instance, can compose a poem under impending peril or hum a strain in the face of death. Such indulgence betraying no tremor in the writing or in the voice, is taken as an infallible index of a large nature - of what we call a capacious mind, which, far from being pressed or crowded, has always room for something more.*

In Eight virtues of Bushido we are reminded of the following:

*Righteousness*: Be acutely honest throughout your dealings with all people. Believe in justice, not from other people, but from yourself. To the true warrior, all points of view are deeply considered regarding honesty, justice and integrity. Warriors make a full commitment to their decisions.

*Heroic Courage*: Hiding like a turtle in a shell is not living at all. A true warrior must have heroic courage. It is absolutely risky. It is living life completely, fully and wonderfully. Heroic courage is not blind. It is intelligent and strong.

*Benevolence, Compassion*: Through intense training and hard work the true warrior becomes quick and strong. They are not as most people. They develop a power that must be used for good. They have compassion. They help their fellow men at every opportunity. If an opportunity does not arise, they go out of their way to find one.

*Respect*: True warriors have no reason to be cruel. They do not need to prove their strength. Warriors are not only respected for their strength in battle, but also by their dealings with others. The true strength of a warrior becomes apparent during difficult times.

*Integrity*: When warriors say that they will perform an action, it is as good as done. Nothing will stop them from completing what they say they will do. They do not have to 'give their word'. They do not have to 'promise'. Speaking and doing are the same action.

*Honour*: Warriors have only one judge of honor and character, and this is themselves. Decisions they make and how these decisions are carried out are a reflection of whom they truly are. You cannot hide from yourself.

*Duty and Loyalty*: Warriors are responsible for everything that they have done and everything that they have said, and all of the consequences that follow. They are immensely loyal to all of those in their care. To everyone that they are responsible for, they remain fiercely true.

*Self-Control*: Warriors feel more than others. This calmness of behavior and composure of mind is rooted in the choice of endurance without a groan, wisdom over ignorance, understanding over confrontation, love over anger, and unbreakability in the face of suffering and loneliness.

War.

I don't understand why bloody battles are necessary. I don't think anybody has ever understood that. I think we can learn a great deal from Bryan Stevenson's words *"Our humanity depends on everyone’s humanity."*

![](images/lady.png)

I think there was a hope that hard earned ideas won in hell of war would spread to no end in time. That, Knightly Vitues, Chivalry, Bushido, Stoicism, would grab a hold of Humanity and never let go, would never stop making us better and wiser. But even a [meme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme) has limitations, the gaps in schooling will end propagation of the most viral lessons, and poverty will return...

Poverty. Poverty, Never Changes.

Police in Chicago are calling for tougher sentencing, the gangs are saying "I have kids, I need to put food on the table". And one of the lessons we learn from this text is that "A human being is more than the worst thing they have ever done."

My fiends, My Heroes. The situation is only hopeless when we stand on the very bottom. When we rise, when we rise onto the shoulders of giants, things change.

The Hopelessness of Poverty becomes transformed into a Hope. It becomes yet another mission, a new challenge. It becomes a source of wisdom, a source of Great Power.

## The Knight of Virtue

![](images/galahad.png)

As we grew so did our grasp on the Human Condition, from bloody and warring clans of duty and loyalty a new kind of class emerged, The Knight of Virtue.

Superheroes like [Galahad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galahad) carried a message that put servitude second.

*My good blade carves the casques of men, / My tough lance thrusteth sure, / My strength is as the strength of ten, / Because my heart is pure.*

A code of conduct that aimed to revolve around Authenticity was born:

*The right can never die, If one man still recalls, The words are not forgot, If one voice speaks them clear, The code forever shines, If one heart holds it bright: The knight is sworn to valor, His heart knows only virtue, His blade defends the helpless, His might upholds the weak, His words speak only truth, His wrath undoes the wicked.*

![](images/god-speed.jpg)

*"Chivalry! – why, maiden, she is the nurse of pure and high affection – the stay of the oppressed, the redresser of grievances, the curb of the power of the tyrant – Nobility were but an empty name without her, and liberty finds the best protection in her lance and her sword."* - Walter Scott, Ivanhoe (1820)

__Forbearance, Hardihood, Largesse, Benevolence, and Honour.__

## The Lady and The Gentleman

It has been said: *A King may make a Nobleman but he cannot make Gentleman.*

There is no force in the universe that can help a person grow up outside in. In education, the idea of dividing all subjects into tidy categories that make perfect sense takes away from beauty of Knowledge. Coupled with the misunderstanding that we can be taught by being talked at, school can only become an exercise in memorization. A school may make a diploma, but it cannot make a grownup.

![](images/gentleman.jpg)

Gentlemen emerged from Knights, inheriting the philosophies of Knightly Virtues. I am sure every fool, wealthy or poor, tried to call him self a gentleman, but I think back then people paid attention to such claims.

I think the lies that we accept from people of authority, today. Would be treated much more harshly, had the virtues still mattered to an overwhelming majority.

Class, Integrity, Authenticity.

## The Officer

![](images/honor-code.jpg)

We the warriors in pursuits of excellence, band together in sincerity and truth.

May our philosophy be filled with power and may we connect in authenticity.

May we strengthen and increase our admiration for honest dealing and clear thinking, and may our hatered of hypocrisy and pretence never diminish.

May we inspire each other in our endeavor to live above the common levels of life.

May we strengthen each other to choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong, and never to be content with a half truth even if the whole can't be won.

May we endow each other with courage that is born of loyalty to all that is noble and worthy, that scorns to compromise with vice and injustice and knows no fear when truth and right are in jeopardy.

May we guard each other against flippancy and irreverence in the sacred things of life.

May we grant each other new ties of friendship and new opportunities for leadership or service.

May we kindle our hearts in fellowship with those of a cheerful countenance, and soften our hearts with sympathy for those who sorrow and suffer.

May we help each other to maintain Honor untarnished and unsullied and to show forth in our lives the ideals we learned in doing our duty.

All of which we ask in the names of those before us, of those who stand today, and those who are yet to rise.

Here, we come to today, the modern times. In the battle between the Gentleman and The Officer. The Gentleman was lost. The honor code is no longer aimed at Men, it is now aimed at cadets, aimed away from the public. It almost seems like growing up is optional, and things get very strange in deed:

[![West Point Pillow Fight Turns Violent](http://img.youtube.com/vi/85dhw7nulb4/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85dhw7nulb4)

At times like these, where our greatest lessons are forgotten we must look back at where things got lost. At times like these the Knigtly Virtues ring again. As the poem says *The right can never die, If one man still recalls, The words are not forgot, If one voice speaks them clear, The code forever shines, If one heart holds it bright*

I think that one is [Rudyard Kipling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling) I find it delightful that he chose not to be Knighted, he did not need to look back. Some call him the finest example of a Gentleman.

His poem "If" is a magnificent reminder that growing up is not optional.

[![IF, Rudyard Kipling's poem, recited by Sir Michael Caine](http://img.youtube.com/vi/EEFMVIfl2UY/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEFMVIfl2UY)

*IF you can keep your head when all about you<br>
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br>
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
But make allowance for their doubting too;<br>
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,<br>
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,<br>
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:<br>
If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;<br>
If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;<br>
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
And treat those two impostors just the same;<br>
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken<br>
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:<br>
If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
And never breathe a word about your loss;<br>
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>
And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'<br>
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,<br>
if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
If all men count with you, but none too much;<br>
If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,<br>
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,<br>
And - which is more - you'll be a Man, my son!*<br>

Excerpt from [John Galt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Galt)'s Speech:

*To those of you who retain some remnant of dignity and the will to live your lives for yourselves, you have the chance to make the same choice. Examine your values and understand that you must choose one side or the other. Any compromise between good and evil only hurts the good and helps the evil.*

*If you've understood what I've said, stop supporting your destroyers.*

*Don't accept their philosophy.*

*Your destroyers hold you by means of your endurance, your generosity, your innocence, and your love.*

*Don't exhaust yourself to help build the kind of world that you see around you now.*

*In the name of the best within you, don't sacrifice the world to those who will take away your happiness for it.*

[William Ernest Henley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ernest_Henley) wrote:

Out of the night that covers me,
Black as the Pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the scroll.
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul.

I beg the youngest of you, to arrange your life in such a way so that each challenge before you, is the hardest thing you have ever done. To paraphrase Thoreau: I beg you to live and grow up deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, to see what love of wisdom has to teach, and not, when it comes to die, discover that you, my dear friend, had. not. yet. lived.

Life is not random, it is not an accident, you are an emergent plateau in an infinity of time ahead. You are needed, and your lasting contributions are necessary.

Humanity must break away from the circles. Progress in the larger world, begins with you, at home, right now. Just the moment you say, "I am not smart enough", "I am not a hero", "I will never be heard", "I will never be enough", "Too scary". That is how every hero begun, by measuring up; and then by growing up to the challenges before us.

The [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://librivox.org/the-universal-declaration-of-human-rights-by-the-united-nations/) needs work, each generation needs to update it and extend it beyond what it is today, grant it new voices - and there are bright new voices to be heard.

"I hope we will commit ourselves to building a human rights movement to end mass incarceration. A movement for education, not incarceration. A movement for jobs, not jails, and a movement to end
all those forms of legal discrimination against people released from prison. Discrimination denying them basic human rights to work, to shelter, and to food."

73.5 million people in the United States have a criminal record (this does not mean that they were convicted, just that they were arrested on a felony charge). She does mention this in her book [The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Jim_Crow) which is available on [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-New-Jim-Crow-Audiobook/B007QW236E)

Kandice Sumner, has the right idea. Beyond share & donate, her idea, in a word: __Prevention__. She sees young children asking powerful questions. She is trying to help them inherit wisdom from books, stories, history, and push them away from poverty.

Heroism.

Don't be frightened of becoming a hero. It is always the longest possible way there, and it is always on the shoulders of giants, my friends.

By rising to the challenge, you become part of the family of great heroes, of great beings. You see, the adults are not going to run the world forever, by the time you become an adult, they are going to retire.

The job will belong to you. Break out of the circles, and aim up, all the way up.

All the bad ideas must be left behind, and all the good ideas put in one place where we can each share in them, where every member of the human family can Converge on Wisdom.

The human family is not divided by political borders, these aren't the only kids that need help. This is not just a national crisis, it is a global one.

*I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.*

Bruce Lee, was the first Ultra that I have heard of. Ultras are folks like you and I that train to jump a little seedling of corn. Day by day, GRADUALLY, the little corn grows a little bit taller, and the little ultra strives to jump a little bit higher.

In modern times the [C25K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C25K) comes to mind, I invite you all to meet The [Fierce Carly](http://carlifierce.com/10-k-downloads/) Just from plain experience with jogging we can guesstimate that by GRADUALLY increasing the length of distance, we will gain the endurance to run hundreds of miles.

"The human body has limitations. The human spirit is boundless.", "The finish line, is a pine box."

Dean Karnazes, mentions Lactic Acid build up. I think of it as mostly nonsense, where does the lactic acid go when your performance increases from long distance running? Your first mile the first time you run will burn, but the 10,000th time you will feel elation.

Here is Dean’s book, it is a good read: [Ultramarathon Man](https://www.audible.com/pd/Ultramarathon-Man-Audiobook/B002VA3GIU)

It is when you stop, and all time scrolls by you, that really hurts. This is why I write to the youngest of you, one of the greatest Storytellers of all generations once discovered a great wish that we all wish for eventually:

[![Make me young again](http://img.youtube.com/vi/wxmRulRQsLc/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmRulRQsLc)

"Make me young again" - but you are young now, you can make most of it, no wax, because it is all ahead of you. Go, close your eyes and connect with your 80 year old self, and make the wish Killgore Trout did: "Make Me Young Again", and open your eyes, and be young but wiser for it. Therein you will discover the nature of the Ultra. While we live our only life, poetically we live as it was countless lives already. By wiggling forward and back we can see where we are headed, and end up where we always wished to be.

[Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche) is asking you to review your decisions, treat them with more gravity, "Would you be willing to relive your life again, and again, and again? Or would you prefer to stay dead and if so, then you need to review your decision making.":

*The heaviest burden: What, if some day or night, a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you:*

*This life, as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh… must return to you—all in the same succession and sequence—even this spider and this moonlight between the trees and even this moment and I myself. The eternal hourglass of existence is turned over again and again—and you with it, speck of dust!*

*Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: "You are a god, and never have I heard anything more divine!"*

*If this thought were to gain possession of you, it would change you as you are, or perhaps crush you. The question in each and every thing, "do you want this once more and innumerable times more?" would lie upon your actions as the greatest weight.*

Make no mistakes, my friends. The workout is powered by the soul, of a very old warrior, who lived many a lifetime in daydreams, stories, books, and poems. There is no pain, it is just a signal.

On the Mind part, focus on gaining wisdom by all means. On the body part, keep extending your endurance, the pain is too primitive to catch up with an ultra.

By whatever means necessary, risky, or imaginary, we have to keep going forward, up, up, and away, and all the way up, until we become the beings that we once thought the adults already were.

Reaching out for wisdom, standing in relentless pursuit of excellence is not optional. Without growing up we will become weak or ill, and face those circles again.

*A warrior is not about perfection. Or invulnerability. He is about absolute vulnerability. That's the only true courage.* - Soc.

The power of vulnerability, and part two Listening to Shame.

Here's the [Theodore Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt) speech referred to as [The Man in the Arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_in_a_Republic) that Brené mentions:

*It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,
or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,
whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;
who strives valiantly; who errs,
who comes short again and again,
because there is no effort without error and shortcoming;
but who does actually strive to do the deeds;
who knows great enthusiasms,
the great devotions;
who spends himself in a worthy cause;
who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,
and who at the worst,
if he fails,
at least fails while daring greatly,
so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.*

Put on the Superhero Suit and step into the arena, right now. Being ashamed to dance, or waiting until you are perfect to face your next challenge, are just illusions that are holding you back.

You are each to become a Great Being. The world needs Superheroes.

Be it fixing schools, or erasing borders, or just preventing Anthropocene from becoming an [extinction event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction) it will take a Great Being to be heard, Greta Thunberg is a wonderful example, today.

Don't be scared to save the world. Mind is a Reflex Organ, Soc says, and he is right. We must be in charge of ourselves. We have to take out the trash. And, at night, when everything comes at you and wakes you up at 3:13am when you are not ready to fight back, you can always turn on an Audiobook by Bill Bryson, Carl Sagan, or the lovely Sarah Vowell. Night by night, the culture of great beings will add to your culture. On the shoulders of giants also means that come your Golden Age, there will be little heroes checking if you have risen high enough for them to stand on your shoulders.

## Philosopher: Love of Wisdom

![](images/school-of-athens.jpg)

[Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy) (from Greek φιλοσοφία, philosophia, literally "love of wisdom") is the study of general and fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. Philosophia has been called The Mother of All Sciences.

Sir Ken Robinson, in his "How to escape education's death valley" states that the more successful Alternative Education Systems should become the norm, because they are clearly more successful.

[![How to escape education's death valley by Sir Ken Robinson](http://img.youtube.com/vi/wX78iKhInsc/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX78iKhInsc)

I think that some day we maybe able to find great schools, and people like Sir Robinson will help that day come. But it will be too little too late, certainly for us.
In this final chapter I will ask you to take Extreme Ownership of Your Education, and here is Jocko Willink explaining the gravity of the words Extreme Ownership.

[![Extreme Ownership by Jocko Willink](http://img.youtube.com/vi/ljqra3BcqWM/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqra3BcqWM)

(Click image to watch video)

Extreme Ownership of Your Education, simply means __Self Education__. It means learning at your own pace, by your own means, in a sequence that matches you the best.
This is also the meaning of the opening quote by Sun Tzu *"Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win."*

Education is not about GPA, diploma, or career. It is about growing up, it is about being healthy, and strong.
Regardless of where you are headed, whether or not that direction includes Medical School, or a University. You need to Self Educate before sitting down in those classrooms. A classroom may not be the place where you find knowledge, not always, not reliably.

Setting off on an endless Audiobook Adventure, to last you many years, or even decades, is probably the most illustrative example I can fit in a sentence. Astra Taylor, the woman behind the unacceptable [Zizek!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enyG430I2nk), [Examined Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zwmum5_ofU), and now [Democracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHxRj9JWQMs) further explains, and I think serves as an example of what it means to Self Educate.

[![Astra Taylor on the Unschooled Life](http://img.youtube.com/vi/LwIyy1Fi-4Q/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwIyy1Fi-4Q)                        

(Click image to watch video)

The beginning of self education starts with a class of teachers often called Science Popularizers. They don't just teach science, but also restore the connecting lines between all the Daughters of Philosophia, lines lost due to the bleaching effect that categorization of knowledge, standardization of sequence of learning, and standardized testing causes.

The Storytelling of Science is a good overview of who these teachers are, how they think, of their energy and class.

[![The Great Debate: THE STORYTELLING OF SCIENCE, part 1 of 2](http://img.youtube.com/vi/_J4QPz52Sfo/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J4QPz52Sfo)

(Click image to watch video)

Education is simply too important, to be put in somebody else hands. It is your mind, your life, your growing up, your own responsibility.
You must forget the idea that you must be taught to learn, and accept the great responsibility and take extreme ownership of your own Self Education.

## In Closing

My workout consists of three complementary exercises arranged in a way that I don't have to stop.

1. [Dumbbell Lateral Raise](https://youtu.be/FeJP4E4Z-PY?t=121)
2. [Standing Dumbbell Curls](https://youtu.be/av7-8igSXTs)
3. [Overhead Shoulder Press](https://youtu.be/Gu1t7X2yq4M?t=153)

Combined with dancing, which in this context is a form of stretching that doubles as a cardio workout.

Good examples of fine workout songs are [Blade’s Blood Rave](https://youtu.be/F6VJQZxeWNY) for fast cardio and [Blanco Brown's The Git Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7U6AoZ27yE) for rest and some stretching.

I find it really helpful to add sugar to my workout water, but I am sure candy works just as well. Sweetened water (sometimes V8 tomato juice) and good music are the two things that I find most helpful during my routine.


In weight lifting there maybe difficult discomfort 5 – 10 lifts into some routine, then you switch to some other exercise (for example from [Standing Dumbbell Curls](https://youtu.be/av7-8igSXTs) to [Overhead Shoulder Press](https://youtu.be/Gu1t7X2yq4M?t=153) where your biceps rest while you perform the shoulder press), you never sit, you never lie, you use both arms, both legs, you don’t stop to rest. __If you need to stop then your weights are too heavy__, and your workout is not working out.

Start in the beginning, come to the end, and then stop. Start with 3.5lb per hand, even if out of humility, even if just to remind yourself that you always start in the beginning, and you always finish what you start.

Dress for Confidence and Joy

There is no struggle because of music, the parts of your brain that are telling you to stop are weak. They are weaker than the beat of drums, they are weaker than a pretty song.

Workout to the beats of songs, here is a player I eventually settled on: [Professional MP3 HIFI Music Player](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32980109852.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.4efc7ec7pkt8Ur&algo_pvid=121e3087-e613-4dcc-af88-ba55a993e258&algo_expid=121e3087-e613-4dcc-af88-ba55a993e258-1&btsid=9e653dc7-cf62-4fce-8d37-51985af20013&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_10,searchweb201603_52) it costs US $24.80 it is OK, I think. It does not seem Professional, I think it is just because phones are really good these days.

![](images/music-player.jpg)

If you need precision use [this tool](https://www.all8.com/tools/bpm.htm) to get a BPM on a song to make a playlist, and if you are still having difficulty with non-stop exercise despite a chain of slow songs, then use a computer to keep track of your rests. I used an Interval Timer from [https://www.gymboss.com/](https://www.gymboss.com/)

![](images/timer.png)

Keep lowering that rest period until no rest is needed in your routine.

Significant Injuries are more likely if you lift heavy. If you lift heavy a few times, your muscles will not be in a flexible enough state to handle it. Eventually you will pull a muscle, hurt yourself. If you lift 5lb 10,000 times, the chances of getting hurt are much lower. Back pain is still likely to occur, you will need a proper bed, I use the inexpensive [PragmaBed](http://pragmabed.com/)

![](images/bed.jpg)

While our cooling is superior, we do lose electrolytes while we sweat, you need to put them back in. V8 vegetable juice which contains both sodium and potassium is one way to do so, but always with wisdom and in moderation.

Finally we arrive to the point where I explain why you can’t take days off. Think of your body as a good horse to your mind. Take two horses with muscle atrophy, one walks ten steps three times, every other day weekends off, the other trots for eight and half hours every day for many years, no day off. Which horse would you bet on, which horse would have more muscle, which horse would live healthier?

This is a snapshot of one of my workout playlists, primarly Dance Pop as it is easiest to workout to a dance song. I change my playlist almost daily, I search youtube for [Bass Boost](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Bass+Boost), [Dance Pop](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Dance+Pop), [HIIT Songs](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=HIIT+Songs), and [Choreography](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Choreography) as choreographers tend to pick amazing songs:

The staying in the moment that he describes can be induced with a fun and snappy playlist, where non-stop endurance bodybuilding is concerned. I don't mean to trivialize what he is describing, ultramarathons are different from endurance workouts, they take longer and you certainly don't want to depend on your mp3 player to finish. At the same time ultramarathons have relative silence and it is easier to focus in the middle of an interesting run, or pretty dessert; than a gym. I would add that during my jogging days I had success with "separating" my mind from my body, by thinking of my body as a good horse, that will serve well as long as it is treated well.

I also created an Open Source (Free) workout instruction drum song, the mp3 files are available here: [https://github.com/westland-valhalla/drums/releases](https://github.com/westland-valhalla/drums/releases)
