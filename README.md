# Warrior
A short walk in time.

Bodybuilding is a side-effect of something more. Like Confidence, or Happiness, or Success, Bodybuilding will ensue from pursuit of things that are just out of your reach. People who have been hurt, or disadvantaged, or treated unfairly will find rising beyond themselves, to be an instinct. Yellow bellied buttercups like us, need a different approach, need an aim. That aim, without further ado, is becoming a Warrior.

Warrior is the oldest name for it. Since out time in Green Africa we have progressed forward, and the word has changed, several times. But at each stage there are strong lessons to be learned, so let us step through the evolution of the warrior.
