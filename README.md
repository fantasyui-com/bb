# Warrior
A short walk in time.

Bodybuilding is a side-effect of something more. Like Confidence, or Happiness, or Success, Bodybuilding will ensue from pursuit of things that are just out of your reach. People who have been hurt, or disadvantaged, or treated unfairly will find rising beyond themselves, to be an instinct. Yellow bellied buttercups like us, need a different approach, need an aim. That aim, without further ado, is becoming a Warrior.

Warrior is the oldest name for it. Since out time in Green Africa we have progressed forward, and the word has changed, several times. But at each stage there are strong lessons to be learned, so let us step through the evolution of the warrior.

## The Hunter

This artwork has been with me for as long as I can remember, I found it a book entitled “Wszechświat życie człowiek” (Universe, Life, Human) and one of my favorite writers Bill Bryson wrote something just as good [A Short History of Nearly Everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything) you can find it on [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Short-History-of-Nearly-Everything-Audiobook/B002V0KFPW) he gently talks about learning about universe, and even learning how to humbly learn.

From this simple image we can infer some really important facts about who we are, where we belong, the diet we evolved alongside with.

It is worth mentioning that before big rocks, and spears, we would chase animals to death in an act called [Endurance Hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_hunting)

Just from this overview alone, you get the picture of who we are, of where we come from, how we learned to survive. How capable we are, how magnificent.

- We belong in communities, not to live in isolation.
- We are hunters, not for sport, but for survival.
- We have superior cooling, superior intelligence, and we did well hunting without spears.
- We ate fruit, vegetable, meat; that's out optimal diet, the nutrients that we evolved to require for our optimal health.
- We grew up protecting each other, casting out the wrong doers, looking after the little ones so that they may grow to become big hunters.
- We are part of Nature, part of Planet Earth, we depend on it for our health and [Survival](https://youtu.be/TMrtLsQbaok)
- We did not store fat, we were lean, and we knew hunger well.

[Tomoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoe_Gozen) (c. 1157 – 1247) was especially beautiful, with white skin, long hair, and charming features. She was also a remarkably strong archer, and as a swordswoman she was a warrior worth a thousand, ready to confront a demon or a god, mounted or on foot. She handled unbroken horses with superb skill; she rode unscathed down perilous descents. Whenever a battle was imminent, Yoshinaka sent her out as his first captain, equipped with strong armor, an oversized sword, and a mighty bow; and she performed more deeds of valor than any of his other warriors.
