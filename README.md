# Warrior
A short walk in time.

Bodybuilding is a side-effect of something more. Like Confidence, or Happiness, or Success, Bodybuilding will ensue from pursuit of things that are just out of your reach. [Viktor E. Frankl](https://youtu.be/LlC2OdnhIiQ) wrote:

*Don't aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long-run—in the long-run, I say! — success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think about it*

People who have been hurt, or disadvantaged, or treated unfairly will find rising beyond themselves, to be a kind of an instinct. Yellow bellied buttercups like us, need a different approach, need an aim. That aim, without further ado, is becoming a Warrior.

Warrior is the oldest name for it. Since out time in Green Africa we have progressed forward, and the word has changed, several times. But at each stage there are strong lessons to be learned, so let us step through the evolution of the warrior.

## The Hunter

This artwork has been with me for as long as I can remember, I found it a book entitled “Wszechświat życie człowiek” (Universe, Life, Human) and one of my favorite writers Bill Bryson wrote something just as good [A Short History of Nearly Everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything) you can find it on [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Short-History-of-Nearly-Everything-Audiobook/B002V0KFPW) he gently talks about learning about universe, and even learning how to humbly learn.

From this simple image we can infer some really important facts about who we are, where we belong, the diet we evolved alongside with.

It is worth mentioning that before big rocks, and spears, we would chase animals to death in an act called [Endurance Hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_hunting)

Just from this overview alone, you get the picture of who we are, of where we come from, how we learned to survive. How capable we are, how magnificent.

- We belong in communities, not to live in isolation.
- We are hunters, not for sport, but for survival.
- We have superior cooling, superior intelligence, and we did well hunting without spears.
- We ate fruit, vegetable, meat; that's out optimal diet, the nutrients that we evolved to require for our optimal health.
- We grew up protecting each other, casting out the wrong doers, looking after the little ones so that they may grow to become big hunters.
- We are part of Nature, part of Planet Earth, we depend on it for our health and [Survival](https://youtu.be/TMrtLsQbaok)
- We did not store fat, we were lean, and we knew hunger well.

## The Warrior - A capacious mind

![](images/tomoe-gozen.jpg)

*[Tomoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoe_Gozen) (c. 1157 – 1247) was especially beautiful, with white skin, long hair, and charming features. She was also a remarkably strong archer, and as a swordswoman she was a warrior worth a thousand, ready to confront a demon or a god, mounted or on foot. She handled unbroken horses with superb skill; she rode unscathed down perilous descents. Whenever a battle was imminent, Yoshinaka sent her out as his first captain, equipped with strong armor, an oversized sword, and a mighty bow; and she performed more deeds of valor than any of his other warriors.*

Where a Hunter had to be a hunter of perish, becoming a warrior was almost optional. A warrior needed Training, Skill and Wisdom to survive into retirement. In my private opinion, a warrior also needed a tribe. Again, as not to live in isolation.

It is in the wisdom of warriors that we find great inspiration and strength. [Nitobe Inazō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitobe_Inaz%C5%8D) wrote:

*A truly brave man is ever serene; he is never taken by surprise; nothing ruffles the equanimity of his spirit. In the heat of battle he remains cool; in the midst of catastrophes he keeps level his mind. Earthquakes do not shake him, he laughs at storms. We admire him as truly great, who, in the menacing presence of danger or death, retains his self-possession; who, for instance, can compose a poem under impending peril or hum a strain in the face of death. Such indulgence betraying no tremor in the writing or in the voice, is taken as an infallible index of a large nature - of what we call a capacious mind, which, far from being pressed or crowded, has always room for something more.*

In Eight virtues of Bushido we are reminded of the following:

- *Righteousness*: Be acutely honest throughout your dealings with all people. Believe in justice, not from other people, but from yourself. To the true warrior, all points of view are deeply considered regarding honesty, justice and integrity. Warriors make a full commitment to their decisions.

- *Heroic Courage*: Hiding like a turtle in a shell is not living at all. A true warrior must have heroic courage. It is absolutely risky. It is living life completely, fully and wonderfully. Heroic courage is not blind. It is intelligent and strong.

- *Benevolence, Compassion*: Through intense training and hard work the true warrior becomes quick and strong. They are not as most people. They develop a power that must be used for good. They have compassion. They help their fellow men at every opportunity. If an opportunity does not arise, they go out of their way to find one.

- *Respect*: True warriors have no reason to be cruel. They do not need to prove their strength. Warriors are not only respected for their strength in battle, but also by their dealings with others. The true strength of a warrior becomes apparent during difficult times.

- *Integrity*: When warriors say that they will perform an action, it is as good as done. Nothing will stop them from completing what they say they will do. They do not have to 'give their word'. They do not have to 'promise'. Speaking and doing are the same action.

- *Honour*: Warriors have only one judge of honor and character, and this is themselves. Decisions they make and how these decisions are carried out are a reflection of whom they truly are. You cannot hide from yourself.

- *Duty and Loyalty*: Warriors are responsible for everything that they have done and everything that they have said, and all of the consequences that follow. They are immensely loyal to all of those in their care. To everyone that they are responsible for, they remain fiercely true.

- *Self-Control*: Warriors feel more than others. This calmness of behavior and composure of mind is rooted in the choice of endurance without a groan, wisdom over ignorance, understanding over confrontation, love over anger, and unbreakability in the face of suffering and loneliness.

## The Knight - Where might upholds the young

![](images/galahad.jpg)

As we grew so did our grasp on the Human Condition, from bloody and warring clans of respect, honor, duty and loyalty a new kind class emerged: The Knights of Virtue.

Superheroes like [Galahad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Galahad_(poem)): *My good blade carves the casques of men, / My tough lance thrusteth sure, / My strength is as the strength of ten, / Because my heart is pure.*

And a code of conduct that aimed to revolve around Authenticity was born:

*The right can never die, If one man still recalls, The words are not forgot, If one voice speaks them clear, The code forever shines, If one heart holds it bright:
*The knight is sworn to valor, His heart knows only virtue, His blade defends the helpless, His might upholds the weak, His words speak only truth, His wrath undoes the wicked.*


## The Lady and The Gentleman

It has been said: *A King may make a Nobleman but he cannot make Gentleman.*

There is no force in the universe that can help a person grow up.

![](images/gentleman.jpg)

Gentlemen emerged from Knights, inheriting the philosophies of Knightly Virtues. I am sure every fool, wealthy or poor, tried to call him self a gentlemen, but I think back then people paid attention to such claims. I think the lies that we accept from people of authority would be treated much more harshly, the virtues mattered.

## The Officer

![](images/honor-code.jpg)

Here, we come to today, the modern times. In the battle between the Gentleman and The Officer. The Gentleman was lost. The honor code is no longer aimed at Men, it is now aimed at cadets, aimed away from the public. It almost seems like growing up is optional, and things get very strange in deed:
