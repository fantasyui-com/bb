# Warrior
A warrior is she that thrives where'er she be.

Bodybuilding is a side-effect of something more. Like Confidence, or Happiness, or Success, it will ensue from pursuit of things that seem just out of your reach.

*"Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win."* - Sun Tzu

[Viktor E. Frankl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Frankl) wrote,
*"Don't aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long-run—in the long-run, I say! — success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think about it"*

Warrior is the oldest name for it. Since our time in Africa we have progressed forward, and the word has changed many times. At each stage there are strong lessons to be learned, directly, or indirectly.

Whatever your calling, wherever you break away to make your stand, even if you fail to reach the top of your mountain, know that you will surely reach the rays of the sun, know that you will become part of the Great Family of Heroes, know that countless many will follow, and that your footsteps will become a well worn path, in time.

The lessons come from Thinkers, Soldiers, Presidents, Athletes, Mercenaries, Murphy's Law, Mighty Little Girls & Young Ladies, Mothers, Sisters, Brothers, and Fathers. From empathy and compassion, joy and tragedy, triumph and disaster, and great challenges like learning to live and grieve at the same time, or standing with the demonized, disposable, or voiceless.

The lessons come from, Choosing Life.

To progress forward, we must be ready to learn to understand by subtle analogy from all other theories. Theories of survival, of living above the common levels of life, of choosing heroism, choosing greatness. Striving to thrive, rising to impossible challenges, learning to overcome pain and suffering, and standing upon the shoulders of giants to lead the way for others to follow.

Kosmos, by Walt Whitman.

Who includes diversity and is Nature,<br>
Who is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of the earth, and the great charity of the earth and the equilibrium also,<br>
Who has not look’d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing, or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing,<br>
Who contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover,<br>
Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism, spiritualism, and of the æsthetic or intellectual,<br>
Who having consider’d the body finds all its organs and parts good,<br>
Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by subtle analogies all other theories,<br>
The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;<br>
Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in other globes with their suns and moons,<br>

Who, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day but for all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,<br>
The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together.<br>

## Hunter

![](images/bears.jpg)

This artwork has been with me for as long as I can remember, I found it in a book entitled "Wszechświat życie człowiek" (Universe, Life, Human) and one of my favorite writers Bill Bryson wrote something just as good [A Short History of Nearly Everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything) which is available as an [Audiobook](https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Short-History-of-Nearly-Everything-Audiobook/B002V0KFPW) where he gently talks about learning, and what he learned about our universe.

From this simple image we can infer some really important facts about who we are, where we belong, the diet we evolved alongside with.

It is worth mentioning that before big rocks, and spears, we would chase animals to death in an act called [Endurance Hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_hunting)

Just from this overview alone, you get the picture of how capable we are, how noble, how unbreakable, how magnificent.

We belong in communities, not to live in isolation.

We did not store fat, we were lean, and we knew hunger well.

We are hunters, not for sport, but for survival.

We have superior cooling, superior intelligence, and we did well hunting without spears.

We ate fruit, vegetable, meat; that's out optimal diet, the nutrients that we evolved to require for our optimal health.

We grew up protecting each other, casting out those who stand in the way of future generations, looking after the little ones so that they may grow to become great hunters.

We are part of Nature, part of Planet Earth, we depend on it for our health and [Survival](https://youtu.be/TMrtLsQbaok)

In moving. In endless horizons, and mountains, and the sea; we learn to break away, and find our own paths. And there is a slope to each adventure that follows, and the adventurer knows that slope must increase, and the challenges must grow also.

"To die having made Something more equal to the centuries
Than muscle and bone, is mostly to shed weakness" - From Wise Men In Their Bad Hours by Robinson Jeffers.

Our search for wisdom, as well as our climb onto the shoulders of giants, is just the first part of our story. When we learn to push ourselves to travel the hardest slopes, our shoulders will become strong enough to holdup the countless adventurers that are sure to follow. Long after we depart, our hard earned wisdom will retain the momentum of our hardest slopes, to serve as an inextinguishable candle in the dark.

## Warrior of Duty and Loyalty

![](images/zeno-of-citium.jpg)

Zeno was the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy, which he taught in Athens from about 300 BC. Based on the moral ideas of the Cynics, Stoicism laid great emphasis on goodness and peace of mind gained from living a life of Virtue in accordance with Nature.

According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to eudaimonia (happiness) for humans is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not allowing oneself to be controlled by whim, the desire for pleasure, or fear of pain, by using one's mind to understand the world and to do one's part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and justly.

This simple Philosophy would have influenced the Roman Warrior.

![](images/marcus-aurelius.jpg)

Emperor Marcus Aurelius (161-180 AD) shows his clemency towards the vanquished after his success against Germanic tribes. Marcus Aurelius wrote a book titled [Meditations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations) and today it is available as an [Audiobook](https://www.audible.com/pd/Meditations-Audiobook/B004IBRMZS).

![](images/tomoe-gozen.jpg)

*[Tomoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoe_Gozen) (c. 1157 – 1247) was especially beautiful, with white skin, long hair, and charming features. She was also a remarkably strong archer, and as a swordswoman she was a warrior worth a thousand, ready to confront a demon or a god, mounted or on foot. She handled unbroken horses with superb skill; she rode unscathed down perilous descents. Whenever a battle was imminent, Yoshinaka sent her out as his first captain, equipped with strong armor, an oversized sword, and a mighty bow; and she performed more deeds of valor than any of his other warriors.*

Where a Hunter had to be a hunter or perish, becoming a warrior was almost optional. A warrior needed training, skill and wisdom to survive into retirement. In my private opinion, a warrior also needed a tribe. Again, as not to live in isolation.

It is in the wisdom of warriors that we find great inspiration and strength.

[Nitobe Inazō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitobe_Inaz%C5%8D) wrote:
*A truly brave man is ever serene; he is never taken by surprise; nothing ruffles the equanimity of his spirit. In the heat of battle he remains cool; in the midst of catastrophes he keeps level his mind. Earthquakes do not shake him, he laughs at storms. We admire him as truly great, who, in the menacing presence of danger or death, retains his self-possession; who, for instance, can compose a poem under impending peril or hum a strain in the face of death. Such indulgence betraying no tremor in the writing or in the voice, is taken as an infallible index of a large nature - of what we call a capacious mind, which, far from being pressed or crowded, has always room for something more.*

In Eight virtues of Bushido we are reminded of the following:

*Righteousness*: Be acutely honest throughout your dealings with all people. Believe in justice, not from other people, but from yourself. To the true warrior, all points of view are deeply considered regarding honesty, justice and integrity. Warriors make a full commitment to their decisions.

*Heroic Courage*: Hiding like a turtle in a shell is not living at all. A true warrior must have heroic courage. It is absolutely risky. It is living life completely, fully and wonderfully. Heroic courage is not blind. It is intelligent and strong.

*Benevolence, Compassion*: Through intense training and hard work the true warrior becomes quick and strong. They are not as most people. They develop a power that must be used for good. They have compassion. They help their fellow men at every opportunity. If an opportunity does not arise, they go out of their way to find one.

*Respect*: True warriors have no reason to be cruel. They do not need to prove their strength. Warriors are not only respected for their strength in battle, but also by their dealings with others. The true strength of a warrior becomes apparent during difficult times.

*Integrity*: When warriors say that they will perform an action, it is as good as done. Nothing will stop them from completing what they say they will do. They do not have to 'give their word'. They do not have to 'promise'. Speaking and doing are the same action.

*Honour*: Warriors have only one judge of honor and character, and this is themselves. Decisions they make and how these decisions are carried out are a reflection of whom they truly are. You cannot hide from yourself.

*Duty and Loyalty*: Warriors are responsible for everything that they have done and everything that they have said, and all of the consequences that follow. They are immensely loyal to all of those in their care. To everyone that they are responsible for, they remain fiercely true.

*Self-Control*: Warriors feel more than others. This calmness of behavior and composure of mind is rooted in the choice of endurance without a groan, wisdom over ignorance, understanding over confrontation, love over anger, and unbreakability in the face of suffering and loneliness.

War.

I don't understand why bloody battles are necessary. I don't think anybody has ever understood that. I think we can learn a great deal from Bryan Stevenson's words *"Our humanity depends on everyone’s humanity."*

![](images/lady.png)

I think there was a hope that hard earned ideas won in hell of war would spread to no end in time. That, Knightly Vitues, Chivalry, Bushido, Stoicism, would grab a hold of Humanity and never let go, would never stop making us better and wiser. But even a [meme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme) has limitations, the gaps in schooling will end propagation of the most viral lessons, and poverty will return...

Poverty. Poverty, Never Changes.

Police in Chicago are calling for tougher sentencing, the gangs are saying "I have kids, I need to put food on the table". And one of the lessons we learn from this text is that "A human being is more than the worst thing they have ever done."

My friends, my heroes. The situation is only hopeless when we stand on the very bottom. When we rise, when we rise onto the shoulders of giants, things change.

The Hopelessness of Poverty becomes transformed into a Hope. It becomes yet another mission, a new challenge. It becomes a source of wisdom, a source of Great Power.

## The Knight of Virtue

![](images/galahad.png)

As we grew so did our grasp on the Human Condition, from bloody and warring clans of duty and loyalty a new kind of class emerged, The Knight of Virtue.

Superheroes like [Galahad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galahad) carried a message that put servitude second.

*My good blade carves the casques of men, / My tough lance thrusteth sure, / My strength is as the strength of ten, / Because my heart is pure.*

A code of conduct that aimed to revolve around Authenticity was born:

*The right can never die, If one man still recalls, The words are not forgot, If one voice speaks them clear, The code forever shines, If one heart holds it bright: The knight is sworn to valor, His heart knows only virtue, His blade defends the helpless, His might upholds the weak, His words speak only truth, His wrath undoes the wicked.*

![](images/god-speed.jpg)

*"Chivalry! – why, maiden, she is the nurse of pure and high affection – the stay of the oppressed, the redresser of grievances, the curb of the power of the tyrant – Nobility were but an empty name without her, and liberty finds the best protection in her lance and her sword."* - Walter Scott, Ivanhoe (1820)

__Forbearance, Hardihood, Largesse, Benevolence, and Honour.__

## The Lady and The Gentleman

It has been said: *A King may make a Nobleman but he cannot make Gentleman.*

There is no force in the universe that can help a person grow up outside in. In education, the idea of dividing all subjects into tidy categories that make perfect sense takes away from beauty of Knowledge. Coupled with the misunderstanding that we can be taught by being talked at, school can only become an exercise in memorization. A school may make a diploma, but it cannot make a grownup.

![](images/gentleman.jpg)

Gentlemen emerged from Knights, inheriting the philosophies of Knightly Virtues. I am sure every fool, wealthy or poor, tried to call him self a gentleman, but I think back then people paid attention to such claims.

I think the lies that we accept from people of authority, today. Would be treated much more harshly, had the virtues still mattered to an overwhelming majority.

Class, Integrity, Authenticity.

## The Officer

![](images/honor-code.jpg)

We the warriors in pursuits of excellence, band together in sincerity and truth.

May our philosophy be filled with power and may we connect in authenticity.

May we strengthen and increase our admiration for honest dealing and clear thinking, and may our hatered of hypocrisy and pretence never diminish.

May we inspire each other in our endeavor to live above the common levels of life.

May we strengthen each other to choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong, and never to be content with a half truth even if the whole can't be won.

May we endow each other with courage that is born of loyalty to all that is noble and worthy, that scorns to compromise with vice and injustice and knows no fear when truth and right are in jeopardy.

May we guard each other against flippancy and irreverence in the sacred things of life.

May we grant each other new ties of friendship and new opportunities for leadership or service.

May we kindle our hearts in fellowship with those of a cheerful countenance, and soften our hearts with sympathy for those who sorrow and suffer.

May we help each other to maintain Honor untarnished and unsullied and to show forth in our lives the ideals we learned in doing our duty.

All of which we ask in the names of those before us, of those who stand today, and those who are yet to rise.

Here, we come to today, the modern times. In the battle between the Gentleman and The Officer. The Gentleman was lost. The honor code is no longer aimed at Men, it is now aimed at cadets, aimed away from the public. It almost seems like growing up is optional, and things get very strange in deed:

[![West Point Pillow Fight Turns Violent](http://img.youtube.com/vi/85dhw7nulb4/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85dhw7nulb4)

At times like these, where our greatest lessons are forgotten we must look back at where things got lost. At times like these the Knigtly Virtues ring again. As the poem says *The right can never die, If one man still recalls, The words are not forgot, If one voice speaks them clear, The code forever shines, If one heart holds it bright*

I think that one is [Rudyard Kipling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling) I find it delightful that he chose not to be Knighted, he did not need to look back. Some call him the finest example of a Gentleman.

His poem "If" is a magnificent reminder that growing up is not optional.

[![IF, Rudyard Kipling's poem, recited by Sir Michael Caine](http://img.youtube.com/vi/EEFMVIfl2UY/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEFMVIfl2UY)

*IF you can keep your head when all about you<br>
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br>
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
But make allowance for their doubting too;<br>
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,<br>
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,<br>
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:<br>
If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;<br>
If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;<br>
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
And treat those two impostors just the same;<br>
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken<br>
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:<br>
If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
And never breathe a word about your loss;<br>
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>
And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'<br>
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,<br>
if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
If all men count with you, but none too much;<br>
If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,<br>
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,<br>
And - which is more - you'll be a Man, my son!*<br>

Excerpt from [John Galt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Galt)'s Speech:

*To those of you who retain some remnant of dignity and the will to live your lives for yourselves, you have the chance to make the same choice. Examine your values and understand that you must choose one side or the other. Any compromise between good and evil only hurts the good and helps the evil.*

*If you've understood what I've said, stop supporting your destroyers.*

*Don't accept their philosophy.*

*Your destroyers hold you by means of your endurance, your generosity, your innocence, and your love.*

*Don't exhaust yourself to help build the kind of world that you see around you now.*

*In the name of the best within you, don't sacrifice the world to those who will take away your happiness for it.*

[William Ernest Henley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ernest_Henley) wrote:

Out of the night that covers me,
Black as the Pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the scroll.
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul.

I beg the youngest of you, to arrange your life in such a way so that each challenge before you, is the hardest thing you have ever done. To paraphrase Thoreau: I beg you to live and grow up deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, to see what love of wisdom has to teach, and not, when it comes to die, discover that you, my dear friend, had. not. yet. lived.

Life is not random, it is not an accident, you are an emergent plateau in an infinity of time ahead. You are needed, and your lasting contributions are necessary.

Humanity must break away from the circles. Progress in the larger world, begins with you, at home, right now. Just the moment you say, "I am not smart enough", "I am not a hero", "I will never be heard", "I will never be enough", "Too scary". That is how every hero begun, by measuring up; and then by growing up to the challenges before us.

"I hope we will commit ourselves to building a human rights movement to end mass incarceration. A movement for education, not incarceration. A movement for jobs, not jails, and a movement to end
all those forms of legal discrimination against people released from prison. Discrimination denying them basic human rights to work, to shelter, and to food."

73.5 million people in the United States have a criminal record (this does not mean that they were convicted, just that they were arrested on a felony charge). She does mention this in her book [The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Jim_Crow) which is available on [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-New-Jim-Crow-Audiobook/B007QW236E)

Kandice Sumner, has the right idea. Beyond share & donate, her idea, in a word: __Prevention__. She sees young children asking powerful questions. She is trying to help them inherit wisdom from books, stories, history, and push them away from poverty.

It is heartbreaking that videos like "Don't Talk to the Police" must exist. A Police Officer must also be a Hero, a force of Goodness. Any compromise between good and evil only hurts the good and helps the evil.

December 10th, is [The Human Rights Day](https://www.un.org/en/events/humanrightsday/) and yet again, the hopelessness turns to hope as we are granted a globally recognized focal point, and an opportunity to stand on the shoulders of giants.

When this nation is ready, December 10th will become the walkout day. For District Judges, their staff, Attorneys, their assistants, for Bad Cops, Good Police Officers, and their COs.
On their mind will be the thought, that to create a life long, legal, discrimination against an individual, is a Human Rights violation.
It should be impossible to ask the legal community to follow the rule of law in the short term, and violate Human Rights in the long run.

Poverty, plays a massive role in crime. We learn in this letter that opposite of poverty is justice, in other words, poverty is an injustice.
Can we serve as an impartial juror, knowing that the defendant would likely not commit the crime, had they not been fractured by poverty?
Every child has a bright future ahead, Art, Music, Ultramarathons, Astrophysics - goodness - Combinatorial Genomics, and Astro Biology.
But poverty is extremely corrosive, too corrosive to handle, not only in it self, but in the surrounding culture that it frequently creates.
Poverty is a virus armed with addiction, abuse, intolerance, xenophobia, violence, and dark blind stupidity.

Some years from now we will accept the challenge that Michelle Alexander put us to, and we will learn to look ahead far enough to begin to put many more things right.

In great part because of you, my Dear Reader.
Because you will raise your children, with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights high up on the wall.
Both as a sacred document, and as an aim for your child to grow up high enough, to make lasting contributions to, a reminder that growing up, is not optional.

My Dear Heroes, here in US, a state law that goes against federal law is null and void. It is my hope that some day, a much more powerful Universal Declaration of Human Rights may render both State and Federal laws null and void. We are one family, one people. I ask you to build homes with the belief that [the inherent dignity and equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family are the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in all of the world](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html), because our humanity depends on everyone's humanity.

We'll fix it.

![](images/the-runaway.jpg)

Heroism.

Don't be frightened of becoming a hero. It is always the longest possible way there, and it is always on the shoulders of giants, my friends.

By rising to the challenge, you become part of the family of great heroes, of great beings. You see, the adults are not going to run the world forever, by the time you become an adult, they are going to retire.

The job will belong to you. Break out of the circles, and aim up, all the way up.

All the bad ideas must be left behind, and all the good ideas put in one place where we can each share in them, where every member of the human family can Converge on Wisdom.

The human family is not divided by political borders, Kandice's kids aren't the only kids that need help. This is not just a national crisis, it is a global one.

In modern times the [C25K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C25K) comes to mind, I invite you all to meet The [Fierce Carli](http://carlifierce.com/10-k-downloads/) Just from plain experience with jogging we can guesstimate that by GRADUALLY increasing the length of distance, we will gain the endurance to run hundreds of miles.

It is when you stop, and all time scrolls by you, that really hurts. This is why I write to the youngest of you, one of the greatest Storytellers of all generations once discovered a great wish that we all wish for eventually:

"Make me young again" - but you are young now, you can make most of it, no wax, because it is all ahead of you. Go, close your eyes and connect with your 80 year old self, and make the wish Killgore Trout did: "Make Me Young Again", and open your eyes, and be young but wiser for it. Therein you will discover the nature of the Ultra. While we live our only life, poetically we live as it was countless lives already. By wiggling forward and back we can see where we are headed, and end up where we always wished to be.

[Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche) is asking you to review your decisions, treat them with more gravity, "Would you be willing to relive your life again, and again, and again? Or would you prefer to stay dead and if so, then you need to review your decision making.":

*The heaviest burden: What, if some day or night, a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you:*

*This life, as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh… must return to you—all in the same succession and sequence—even this spider and this moonlight between the trees and even this moment and I myself. The eternal hourglass of existence is turned over again and again—and you with it, speck of dust!*

*Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: "You are a god, and never have I heard anything more divine!"*

*If this thought were to gain possession of you, it would change you as you are, or perhaps crush you. The question in each and every thing, "do you want this once more and innumerable times more?" would lie upon your actions as the greatest weight.*

Make no mistakes, my friends. The workout is powered by the soul, of a very old warrior, who lived many a lifetime in daydreams, stories, books, and poems. There is no pain, it is just a signal.

On the Mind part, focus on gaining wisdom by all means. On the body part, keep extending your endurance, the pain is too primitive to catch up with an ultra.

By whatever means necessary, risky, or imaginary, we have to keep going forward, up, up, and away, and all the way up, until we become the beings that we once thought the adults already were.

Here's the [Theodore Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt) speech referred to as [The Man in the Arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_in_a_Republic) that Brené mentions:

*It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,
or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,
whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;
who strives valiantly; who errs,
who comes short again and again,
because there is no effort without error and shortcoming;
but who does actually strive to do the deeds;
who knows great enthusiasms,
the great devotions;
who spends himself in a worthy cause;
who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,
and who at the worst,
if he fails,
at least fails while daring greatly,
so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.*

Put on the Superhero Suit and step into the arena, right now. Being ashamed to dance, or waiting until you are perfect to face your next challenge, are just illusions that are holding you back.

You are each to become a Great Being. The world needs Superheroes.

Be it fixing schools, or erasing borders, or just preventing Anthropocene from becoming an [extinction event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction) it will take a Great Being to be heard, Greta Thunberg is a wonderful example, today.

## Philosopher: Love of Wisdom

![](images/school-of-athens.jpg)

[Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy) (from Greek φιλοσοφία, philosophia, literally "love of wisdom") is the study of general and fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. Philosophia has been called The Mother of All Sciences.

Sir Ken Robinson, in his "How to escape education's death valley" states that the more successful Alternative Education Systems should become the norm, because they are clearly more successful.

[![How to escape education's death valley by Sir Ken Robinson](http://img.youtube.com/vi/wX78iKhInsc/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX78iKhInsc)

I think that some day we maybe able to find great schools, and people like Sir Robinson will help that day come. But it will be too little too late, certainly for us.
In this final chapter I will ask you to take Extreme Ownership of Your Education, and here is Jocko Willink explaining the gravity of the words Extreme Ownership.

[![Extreme Ownership by Jocko Willink](http://img.youtube.com/vi/ljqra3BcqWM/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqra3BcqWM)

(Click image to watch video)

Extreme Ownership of Your Education, simply means __Self Education__. It means learning at your own pace, by your own means, in a sequence that matches you the best.
This is also the meaning of the opening quote by Sun Tzu *"Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win."*

Education is not about GPA, diploma, or career. It is about growing up, it is about being healthy, and strong.
Regardless of where you are headed, whether or not that direction includes Medical School, or a University. You need to Self Educate before sitting down in those classrooms. A classroom may not be the place where you find knowledge, not always, not reliably.

Setting off on an endless Audiobook Adventure, to last you many years, or even decades, is probably the most illustrative example I can fit in a sentence. Astra Taylor, the woman behind the unacceptable [Zizek!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enyG430I2nk), [Examined Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zwmum5_ofU), and now [Democracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHxRj9JWQMs) further explains, and I think serves as an example of what it means to Self Educate.

[![Astra Taylor on the Unschooled Life](http://img.youtube.com/vi/LwIyy1Fi-4Q/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwIyy1Fi-4Q)                        

(Click image to watch video)

The beginning of self education starts with a class of teachers often called Science Popularizers. They don't just teach science, but also restore the connecting lines between all the Daughters of Philosophia, lines lost due to the bleaching effect that categorization of knowledge, standardization of sequence of learning, and standardized testing causes.

The Storytelling of Science is a good overview of who these teachers are, how they think, of their energy and class.

[![The Great Debate: THE STORYTELLING OF SCIENCE, part 1 of 2](http://img.youtube.com/vi/_J4QPz52Sfo/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J4QPz52Sfo)

(Click image to watch video)

Education is simply too important to be put in someone else's hands.
It is your mind, your life, your growing up, your own responsibility.
Above all, your body of knowledge has massive infuence over your private decision-making, over your freedom of choice, over your freedom of will.
Decision-making is one of the most sacred things in life, and only you should have control over that.

I urge you to forget the idea that you must be taught to learn.
I urge you to accept that great responsibility yourself.
You must take extreme ownership of your own Self Education.

The $35 [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) is the most handsome in a class of computers called [Single-board computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer). They just released version 4, __so make sure you get that one__; and don't forget a monitor. BestBuy does sell the PI, packaged in the [Raspberry Pi 4 Cana Kit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rcNjgVgc-I). Personally, I think getting the original keyboard and mouse is really cool, I am not a fan of the plastic case and would go for a cool looking [Heat Sink "Case"](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VD568FB/ref=twister_B07VD58LGV?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1) and then probably short something out. Good news is that ashens has a two part review of all the popular cases here you go: [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTlB6oju5w) and [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYb2IEsfhnE).

Now, when the Little Hacker Lady, logs into her ~~daddy's~~ dad's computer she makes it talk using the __say__ command. A command is a feature of the Operating System, using commands is a management or administrative task, it is not really true programming, but it is OK to call it that. The say command uses [speech synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis) to convert text to speech. The say command resides on her dad's computer, and thus uses her dad's speaker. She executes the command at [5:10](https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=310)

The command she executes is wonderfully illustrative:

```sh

  say -v serena dad watch out

```

You see that ```-v``` that's a special directive that states when executing the say command use the ```v```oice of serena, serena is a cute name for a library of sounds, the say command supports multiple voices, serena is one of them.

How do people know that ```-v``` means voice, and how do they know that serena is one of the voices? __Nobody knows this at first__, before a person executes a command they read about it in a manual. The manual command is called ```man``` and people usually type ```man``` followed by the command-name that they want to learn about. In this case: ```man say``` (meaning bring up the manual page for the say command). The man page will tell you how you can list all the available voices too (```say -v=?```), a command like ```say``` can do multiple things based on what you are trying to do. Here is the internet version of a man page for say: [https://ss64.com/osx/say.html](https://ss64.com/osx/say.html)

People are not happy with this. Many try to create simplified man pages, here is one example [https://tldr.sh/](https://tldr.sh/) but it is always best to go to the source, and just get used to the man command.

She didn't need to use the serena voice library, she could have just executed:

```sh

  say dad watch out

```

And the say command would use the default voice. The say command is mostly available on Macs, Raspberry Pi will likely use the ```espeak``` command.

```sh

espeak "dad watch out"

```

Espeak command is slightly different, for it gets confused by multiple words, you have to join them together by wrapping them in quotes. A programmer should demand that his program code has good hygiene. eSpeak simply said "I am not just going to read everything that you type at me" whereas the programmer that made the say command said "Let's just assume that whatever they throw at us needs to be converted to speech unless something starts with a hyphen". The say command makes assumptions, whereas espeak is very strict about input.

To log into her dad's computer she uses the ssh command. ssh is just a program that establishes a secure (encrypted) shell connection between two computers. She executes ```ssh alex@192.168.1.27``` at [1:27](https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=87). And begins using the ssh program, it looks almost the same as her own shell to be convenient. Even though little changes on her screen she is in a full screen program, and once she is authenticated her shell prompt changes to that of the remote system. It goes from ```pi@calebpi ~ $``` to ```[]~$[]```.

A shell prompt the thing that indicates that you are free to type commands. Her dad's shell prompt is broken, he messed up with whatever was supposed to go in between those square brackets, it maybe that he is using fonts that the Raspberry PI does not have, or some mess like that. My prompt as I write this is ```[user@computer warrior]$``` that means username is user, my computer's network name is computer, and and the directory I am in is warrior.

The dollar sign ```$``` indicates that I, alex, and pi are normal users. You can escalate your system privileges to become a system administrator where you can read or delete other user's files, on most systems the dollar sign would then change to the pound sign ```#```, to indicate that care must be taken as you are in special privileges mode, often called [root](http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/R/root.html).

There is a wee bit of jargon here, but don't worry. ESR is managing a jargon file you can read at http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/go01.html he has a cool [HOWTO](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) on hackers from which I quote below:

"__What Is a Hacker?__

*There is a community, a shared culture, of expert programmers and networking wizards that traces its history back through decades to the first time-sharing minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet experiments. The members of this culture originated the term ‘hacker’. Hackers built the Internet. Hackers made the Unix operating system what it is today. Hackers make the World Wide Web work. If you are part of this culture, if you have contributed to it and other people in it know who you are and call you a hacker, you're a hacker.*

*The hacker mind-set is not confined to this software-hacker culture. There are people who apply the hacker attitude to other things, like electronics or music — actually, you can find it at the highest levels of any science or art. Software hackers recognize these kindred spirits elsewhere and may call them ‘hackers’ too — and some claim that the hacker nature is really independent of the particular medium the hacker works in.*

*There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers, but aren't. These are people (mainly adolescent males) who get a kick out of breaking into computers and phreaking the phone system. Real hackers call these people ‘crackers’ and want nothing to do with them. Real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy, irresponsible, and not very bright, and object that being able to break security doesn't make you a hacker any more than being able to hotwire cars makes you an automotive engineer. Unfortunately, many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word ‘hacker’ to describe crackers; this irritates real hackers no end.*

*The basic difference is this: hackers build things, crackers break them."*

![](images/glider.png)

(This is a glider, a bit of a symbol of hackers, who are like cats, and do not like each other, heards, or stupid symbols. The glider comes from [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)) the little things manufactured by [Gospers glider gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_(cellular_automaton)) and walking off towards lower right are gliders in action.

![](images/gliders.gif)


At [3:49](https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=229) the Little Lady Hacker explains that she will be shutting down her dad's code editor, and writes down the Process ID number ```95251```. Mac users frequently use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) code editor. She issues the ```kill``` command with the ```-9``` switch, this is a terrible idea, as it basically crashes her dad's code editor and the ```-9``` ensures there is no way to save data. Here is the man page for the kill command [https://linux.die.net/man/1/kill](https://linux.die.net/man/1/kill). Unix programs that are actively running are called processes (as in a program that is processing something) and each process has a number.
The kill command can be used during development and debugging, in a reboot scenario, or when battery is about to die on a laptop, it has its proper uses. As a joke, is already bad to use the kill command on a process as it sends a TERM[inate] signal. As a programmer you can add a signal handler in your program, and then in case of TERM signal you can for example ask the user to save his data. The -9 sends a KILL signal. There is no handler for the KILL signal, there is no saving work, the process is destroyed by the Operating System, whatever he was working on is lost. She executes ```kill -9 95251``` at [5:26](https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=326) his code editor disappears instantly. __Yikes!__


Originally, the beauty of commands was in being predictable, readable, and not causing surprises. UNIX style operating systems, are well thought out. But, people will cram a lot more than they should, and it gets out of control, here is a mild example of mixing some video files with the ffmpeg command: ```ffmpeg -i test1.avi -i test2.avi -vcodec copy -acodec copy -vcodec copy -acodec copy test12.avi -newvideo -newaudio``` which I hate; I have some guesses as to what the ff stands for. You can visit the man page here: [https://linux.die.net/man/1/ffmpeg](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ffmpeg)

There is a feature in the command world, that can deal with high complexity, and that is the pipe. Meaning two commands can be connected by a pipe like this: ```print "hello world" | uppercase``` which would result in printing ```HELLO WORLD``` there is also a feature of pipes that creates files and that is the greater than symbol "&gt;" so we could say: ```print "hello world" | uppercase > greetings.txt``` and instead of seeing it on the screen we'd see it in the file named greetings.txt

If you look really closely at a screen, especially an older color TV you will see that it is made up of little red green and blue dots like so:

[![Pixels](http://img.youtube.com/vi/UdWCUr1FDqU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdWCUr1FDqU)
[![Pixels](http://img.youtube.com/vi/DR2dRWfr7m0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR2dRWfr7m0)

(Click images to watch videos)

Let us leap from screens to actual images, and talk about real pixels as they exist in an image, and not a monitor.

[![Real Pixels](http://img.youtube.com/vi/15aqFQQVBWU/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/15aqFQQVBWU?t=44)

It would __SUCK!__ to try to do something to those colors with raw command line, it is possible by writing supporting commands such as ```spaghettify``` which would unravel an image into a line of colors, and corresponding ```unspaghettify``` which would ask for width of the original image and reconstitute it. At the center we would have a filter of pixels, and we en'd up running something like this:

```sh

spaghettify image.jpg
| filter -t darken
| unspaghettify -w 1024
> image-darkened.jpg

```

Where ```filter -t darken``` would mean use filter of type darken, and ```unspaghettify -w 1024``` would mean that the width of the original image was 1024 pixels.

But using pipes and redirects is not how one would control an array of little pixels. The best way to do it, is to use a programming language. This way we won't need to suck spaghetti through pipes and remember widths and we can cram a lot more into the clockwork without making a mess.

Here is a JavaScript example of getting at the raw color information of an image, it is taken from a tiny and dusty [node.js](https://nodejs.org) library called [get-image-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/get-image-data) rather than pipes to pass information around everything is wide open. Rather than being __SMUSHED__ into commands with pages and pages of... manual pages the red green blue, actually contain numbers from 0 to 255, and one can do math with it.

```JavaScript

var image = require('get-image-data')

image('./image.jpg', function (err, info) {

  var data = info.data
  var height = info.height
  var width = info.width

  for (var i = 0, l = data.length; i < l; i += 4) {

    var red = data[i]
    var green = data[i + 1]
    var blue = data[i + 2]
    var alpha = data[i + 3]

    // do something mathematical with red variable
    red = red - 50;

  }

})

```

This is what Dianna means when she talks about puzzles, you got all this color information, and you can mess with it, and then take the numbers and encode then as a jpg, or maybe you can make a movie, where you scramble the pixels on purpose to create what is known as [Glitch Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_art). Just about 100 lines of code, bunch of selfies, and you become an artist.

Armed with Color Theory, RGB values, and a library like [Chroma.js](https://vis4.net/chromajs/) and you are out on an expedition.

__Please Note:__ [Chroma.js](https://vis4.net/chromajs/) library has __LIVE CODE EXAMPLES__ that you can play with, for example you can change the code in the first example from:

```JavaScript

chroma('pink').darken().saturate(2).hex()

```

to the ```64, 224, 208``` which is the Turquoise they use in the Pixel explanation video above, and play around with the colors and functions.

```JavaScript

chroma(64, 224, 208).darken().saturate(2).hex()

```

The __"BASIC"__ joke that Dianna makes is explained in the video below.

## In Closing

My workout consists of three complementary exercises arranged in a way that I don't have to stop.

1. [Dumbbell Lateral Raise](https://youtu.be/FeJP4E4Z-PY?t=121)
2. [Standing Dumbbell Curls](https://youtu.be/av7-8igSXTs)
3. [Overhead Shoulder Press](https://youtu.be/Gu1t7X2yq4M?t=153)

Combined with dancing, which in this context is a form of stretching that doubles as a cardio workout.

Good examples of fine workout songs are [Blade’s Blood Rave](https://youtu.be/F6VJQZxeWNY) for fast cardio and [Blanco Brown's The Git Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7U6AoZ27yE) for rest and some stretching.

I find it really helpful to add sugar to my workout water, but I am sure candy works just as well. Sweetened water (sometimes V8 tomato juice) and good music are the two things that I find most helpful during my routine.


In weight lifting there maybe difficult discomfort 5 – 10 lifts into some routine, then you switch to some other exercise (for example from [Standing Dumbbell Curls](https://youtu.be/av7-8igSXTs) to [Overhead Shoulder Press](https://youtu.be/Gu1t7X2yq4M?t=153) where your biceps rest while you perform the shoulder press), you never sit, you never lie, you use both arms, both legs, you don’t stop to rest. __If you need to stop then your weights are too heavy__, and your workout is not working out.

Start in the beginning, come to the end, and then stop. Start with 3.5lb per hand, even if out of humility, even if just to remind yourself that you always start in the beginning, and you always finish what you start.

Dress for Confidence and Joy

There is no struggle because of music, the parts of your brain that are telling you to stop are weak. They are weaker than the beat of drums, they are weaker than a pretty song.

Workout to the beats of songs, here is a player I eventually settled on: [Professional MP3 HIFI Music Player](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32980109852.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.4efc7ec7pkt8Ur&algo_pvid=121e3087-e613-4dcc-af88-ba55a993e258&algo_expid=121e3087-e613-4dcc-af88-ba55a993e258-1&btsid=9e653dc7-cf62-4fce-8d37-51985af20013&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_10,searchweb201603_52) it costs US $24.80 it is OK, I think. It does not seem Professional, I think it is just because phones are really good these days.

![](images/music-player.jpg)

If you need precision use [this tool](https://www.all8.com/tools/bpm.htm) to get a BPM on a song to make a playlist, and if you are still having difficulty with non-stop exercise despite a chain of slow songs, then use a computer to keep track of your rests. I used an Interval Timer from [https://www.gymboss.com/](https://www.gymboss.com/)

![](images/timer.png)

Keep lowering that rest period until no rest is needed in your routine.

Significant Injuries are more likely if you lift heavy. If you lift heavy a few times, your muscles will not be in a flexible enough state to handle it. Eventually you will pull a muscle, hurt yourself. If you lift 5lb 10,000 times, the chances of getting hurt are much lower. Back pain is still likely to occur, you will need a proper bed, I use the inexpensive [PragmaBed](http://pragmabed.com/)

![](images/bed.jpg)

While our cooling is superior, we do lose electrolytes while we sweat, you need to put them back in. V8 vegetable juice which contains both sodium and potassium is one way to do so, but always with wisdom and in moderation.

Finally we arrive to the point where I explain why you can’t take days off. Think of your body as a good horse to your mind. Take two horses with muscle atrophy, one walks ten steps three times, every other day weekends off, the other trots for eight and half hours every day for many years, no day off. Which horse would you bet on, which horse would have more muscle, which horse would live healthier?

This is a snapshot of one of my workout playlists, primary Dance Pop as it is easiest to workout to a dance song. I change my playlist almost daily, I search youtube for [Hard Bass](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Hard+Bass), [Bass Boost](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Bass+Boost), [Dance Pop](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Dance+Pop), [HIIT Songs](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=HIIT+Songs), and [Choreography](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Choreography) as choreographers tend to pick amazing songs:

The staying in the moment that he describes can be induced with a fun and snappy playlist, where non-stop endurance bodybuilding is concerned. I don't mean to trivialize what he is describing, ultramarathons are different from endurance workouts, they take longer and you certainly don't want to depend on your mp3 player to finish. At the same time ultramarathons have relative silence and it is easier to focus in the middle of an interesting run, or pretty dessert; than a gym. I would add that during my jogging days I had success with "separating" my mind from my body, by thinking of my body as a good horse, that will serve well as long as it is treated well.

I also created an Open Source (Free) workout instruction drum song, the mp3 files are available here: [https://github.com/westland-valhalla/drums/releases](https://github.com/westland-valhalla/drums/releases)
