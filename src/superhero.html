        <div class="widget quote" data-author="Lucy Hone">

          <p>
            "Number One: Resilient people get that [terrible disasters do happen], they know that suffering is part of life, this doesn't mean they actually welcome it [...] just that when the tough times come they seem to know that suffering is part of every human existence and knowing this stops you from feeling discriminated against when the tough times come."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Number Two: Resilient people are really good at choosing carefully where they select their attention. They have a habit of realistically appraising situations, and typically managing to focus on the things that they can change, and somehow accept the things that they can't."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Make an intentional deliberate ongoing effort to tune in to what's good in your world."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Number Three: Resilient people ask themselves "Is what I'm doing helping or harming me?" this is a question that's used a lot in good therapy."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Is what I'm doing helping or harming me?"

          <p>
            Dan Millman, wrote a book in which he featured him self as a
            character, next to the imaginary wise man Socrates, Soc for short. Dan
            is someone who quite literally pulled him self up by his own shoe laces.

          <p>Here is <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Way-of-the-Peaceful-Warrior-Audiobook/B002UZKKSU">Way of the Peaceful Warrior Audiobook</a> narrated by the man himself. It was also made into a movie starring Nick Nolte as Soc.</p>

        <div class="widget text" data-title="By Whatever Means">
          <p>By whatever means necessary, risky, or imaginary, we have to keep
            going forward, up, up, and away, and all the way up, until we become the
            beings that we once thought the adults already were.</p>

          <p>Reaching out for wisdom, standing in relentless pursuit of excellence
            is not optional. Without growing up we will become weak or ill, and
            face those circles again.</p>

          <p>
            The mighty Bren&#xE9; Brown further elucidates on the subject of vulnerability through what in my opinion is a two part TED talk:
            The power of vulnerability, and part two Listening to Shame.

            <p>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,</p><p>
            </p><p>or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.</p><p>
            </p><p>The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,</p><p>
            </p><p>whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;</p><p>
            </p><p>who strives valiantly; who errs,</p><p>
            </p><p>who comes short again and again,</p><p>
            </p><p>because there is no effort without error and shortcoming;</p><p>
            </p><p>but who does actually strive to do the deeds;</p><p>
            </p><p>who knows great enthusiasms,</p><p>
            </p><p>the great devotions;</p><p>

          <p>Don&#x2019;t be scared to save the world. Mind is a Reflex Organ, Soc says,
            and he is right. We must be in charge of ourselves. We have to take out
            the trash. And, at night, when everything comes at you and wakes you up
            at 3:13am when you are not ready to fight back, you can always turn on
            an Audiobook by Bill Bryson, Carl Sagan, or the lovely Sarah Vowell.
            Night by night, the culture of great beings will add to your culture. On
            the shoulders of giants also means that come your Golden Age, there
            will be little heroes checking if you have risen high enough for them to
            stand on your shoulders.</p>
