          <p>Dan Millman, wrote a book in which he featured him self as a
            character, next to the imaginary wise man Socrates, Soc for short. Dan
            is someone who quite literally pulled him self up by his own shoe laces.</p>

          <p>There is a similar theme in “No retreat No surrender”, where the boy calls upon Sensei Lee, to come an teach him.</p>

          <p>By whatever means necessary, risky, or imaginary, we have to keep
            going forward, up, up, and away, and all the way up, until we become the
            beings that we once thought the adults already were.</p>

          <p>Reaching out for wisdom, standing in relentless pursuit of excellence
            is not optional. Without growing up we will become weak or ill, and
            face those circles again.</p>

          <p>Dan Millman, teaches us to take out the trash, to erase doubt,
            negativity, fear, keep moving forward and become Vulnerable and Fearless
            Warriors.</p>

          <p><em>A warrior is not about perfection. Or invulnerability. He is about absolute vulnerability. That’s the only true courage.</em> - Soc.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <p>The mighty Brené Brown further elucidates on the subject of vulnerability through what in my opinion is a two part TED talk:
            The power of vulnerability, and part two Listening to Shame.</p>

          <p>Here’s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> speech referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_in_a_Republic">The Man in the Arena</a> that Brené mentions:</p>

          <p><em>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,
              or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
              The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,
              whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;
              who strives valiantly; who errs,
              who comes short again and again,
              because there is no effort without error and shortcoming;
              but who does actually strive to do the deeds;
              who knows great enthusiasms,
              the great devotions;
              who spends himself in a worthy cause;
              who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,
              and who at the worst,
              if he fails,
              at least fails while daring greatly,
              so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</em></p>

            ashamed to dance, or waiting until you are perfect to face your next
            challenge, are just illusions that are holding you back.</p>

          <p>Erica Goldson carries on her message and self-education, aiming to
            inspire and help the world grow. She discovered the absence of teachers
            early on, and immediately became an educator her self.</p>

          <p>Don’t be scared to save the world. Mind is a Reflex Organ, Soc says,
            and he is right. We must be in charge of ourselves. We have to take out
            the trash. And, at night, when everything comes at you and wakes you up
            at 3:13am when you are not ready to fight back, you can always turn on
            an Audiobook by Bill Bryson, Carl Sagan, or the lovely Sarah Vowell.
            Night by night, the culture of great beings will add to your culture. On
            the shoulders of giants also means that come your Golden Age, there
            will be little heroes checking if you have risen high enough for them to
            stand on your shoulders.</p>

          <p>Never give up, whatever your calling, never retreat, never surrender.
            And in the absence of teachers, you become the teacher. Sure, maybe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law">anything that can go wrong will go wrong</a> but that’s just the next challenge, your next level up. An opportunity to
            stand even taller.</p>

          <p>Come morning, it does not matter how old you are, or how many times
            you failed already, the rest of your life is always ahead of you. <strong>Make the rest of your life, the best of your life.</strong></p>
