          <p>I beg the youngest of you, to arrange your life in such a way so that
            each challenge before you, is the hardest thing you have ever done.
          </p>

          <p>
            To paraphrase Thoreau: I beg you to live and grow up deliberately, to front
            only the essential facts of life, to see what love of wisdom has to
            teach, and not, when it comes to die, discover that you, my dear friend,
            had. not. yet. lived.</p>

          <p>Life is not random, it is not an accident, you are an emergent
            plateau in an infinity of time ahead. You are needed, and your lasting
            contributions are necessary.</p>

            world, begins with you, at home, right now. Just the moment you say, &#x201C;I
            am not smart enough&#x201D;, &#x201C;I am not a hero&#x201D;, &#x201C;I will never be heard&#x201D;, &#x201C;I
            will never be enough&#x201D;, &#x201C;Too Scary!&#x201D;. That is how every hero begun, by
            measuring up; and then by growing up to the challenges before us.</p>

          <p>I hope we will commit ourselves to building a human rights movement
            to end mass incarceration. A movement for education, not incarceration. A
            movement for jobs, not jails, and a movement to end
            all those forms of legal discrimination against people released from
            prison. Discrimination denying them basic human rights to work, to

            December 10th, is <a href="https://www.un.org/en/events/humanrightsday/">The Human Rights Day</a>
            and yet again, the hopelessness turns to hope as we are granted a
            globally recognized focal point, and an opportunity to stand on the
            shoulders of giants.
          </p>

          <p>
            When this nation is ready, December 10th will become the walkout day.
            For District Judges, their staff, Attorneys, their assistants, for Bad
            Cops, Good Police Officers, and their COs.
            On their mind will be the thought, that to create a life long, legal,
            discrimination against an individual, is a Human Rights violation.
            It should be impossible to ask the legal community to follow the rule of
            law in the short term, and violate Human Rights in the long run.

          <p>Poverty, plays a massive role in crime. We learn in this letter that
            opposite of poverty is justice, in other words, poverty is an injustice.
            Can we serve as an impartial juror, knowing that the defendant would
            likely not commit the crime, had they not been fractured by poverty?
            Every child has a bright future ahead, Art, Music, Ultramarathons,
            Astrophysics - goodness - Combinatorial Genomics, and Astrobiology.
            But poverty is extremely corrosive, too corrosive to handle, not only in
            it self, but in the surrounding culture that it frequently creates.
            Poverty is a virus armed with addiction, abuse, intolerance, xenophobia,
            violence, and dark blind stupidity.</p>

          <p>Some years from now we will accept the challenge that Michelle
            Alexander put us to, and we will learn to look ahead far enough to begin
            to put many more things right.</p>

          <p>In great part because of you, my Dear Reader.
            Because you will raise your children, with the Universal Declaration of
            Human Rights high up on the wall.
            Both as a sacred document, and as an aim for your child to grow up high
            enough, to make lasting contributions to, a reminder that growing up, is
            not optional.</p>

          <p>My Dear Heroes, here in US, a state law that goes against federal law
            is null and void. It is my hope that some day, a much more powerful
            Universal Declaration of Human Rights may render both State and Federal
            laws null and void. We are one family, one people.
          </p>

          <p>
            I ask you to build
            homes with the belief that <a href="https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html">the
            inherent dignity and equal and inalienable rights of all members of the
            human family are the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in all of
            the world</a>, because our humanity depends on everyone&#x2019;s humanity.</p>

          <p>Don&#x2019;t be frightened of becoming a hero. It is always the longest
            possible way there, and it is always on the shoulders of giants, my
            friends.</p>

          <p>By rising to the challenge, you become part of the family of great
            heroes, of great beings. You see, the adults are not going to run the
            world forever, by the time you become an adult, they are going to
            retire.</p>

          <p>The job will belong to you. Break out of the circles, and aim up, all the way up.</p>

          <p>All the bad ideas must be left behind, and all the good ideas put in
            one place where we can each share in them, where every member of the
            human family can Converge on Wisdom.</p>
