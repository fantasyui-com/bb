          The $35 <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> is the most handsome in a class of computers called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer">Single-board computers</a>. They just released version 4,
          <strong>so make sure you get that one</strong>; and don&#x2019;t forget a monitor. BestBuy does sell the PI, packaged in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rcNjgVgc-I">Raspberry Pi 4 Cana Kit</a>.
          Personally, I think getting the original keyboard and mouse is really
          cool, I am not a fan of the plastic case and would go for a cool looking
          <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VD568FB/ref=twister_B07VD58LGV?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Heat Sink &#x201C;Case&#x201D;</a> - and then probably short something out. Good news is that ashens has a two part review of all the popular cases here you go:
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTlB6oju5w">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYb2IEsfhnE">Part 2</a>. Heads up, ashens is an odd British man that utters odd British phrases.

          <p>There is a class of monitors called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=+Portable+Monitors">Portable Monitors</a>
            it is still nice to have a desk one, but if you are wondering which one
            to get; get a portable first (the cheapest one is $99), then you can
            take it to Starbucks, plug in your PI, keyboard and mouse, and
            headphones; and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qfa9hGJzoY">compose some music</a> with <a href="https://lmms.io/">LMMS</a> whilst <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mgrY-U9_8E">pondering album art</a> with <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>.</p>

          <p>Also please don&#x2019;t forget about <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=projectors">Projectors</a> as those too are a kind of monitor (the cheap ones are $50 - $75). A projector turns any

        <div class="widget text" data-title="Heist">

          <p>She likley stole her <del>daddy&#x2019;s</del> dad&#x2019;s password by using her older brother&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/keylogger/s?k=keylogger">key logger</a>.
            To log into her dad&#x2019;s computer she uses the ssh command. ssh is just a
            program that establishes a secure (encrypted) connection between two
            computers. She executes <span class="strong">ssh alex@192.168.1.27</span> at <a href="https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=87">1:27</a>. And begins using the ssh program.</p>

          <p>The remote shell, for convenience sake, looks almost the same as her
            own local shell. Even though very little changes on her screen she is in
            a full-screen program now, and once she is authenticated her shell
            prompt changes to that of the remote system. It goes from <span class="strong">pi@calebpi ~ $</span> to <span class="strong">[]~$[]</span>.</p>

          <p>A shell prompt is the thing that indicates that you are free to type
            commands. Her dad&#x2019;s shell prompt is broken, he messed up with whatever
            was supposed to go in between those square brackets, it maybe that he is
            using fonts that the Raspberry PI does not have, or some mess like
            that. My prompt as I write this is <span class="strong">[user@computer warrior]$</span> that means username is user, my computer&#x2019;s network name is computer, and the directory I am in is warrior.</p>

          <p>The dollar sign <span class="strong">$</span>
            indicates that I, alex, and pi are normal users. You can escalate your
            system privileges to become a system administrator where you can read or
            delete other user&#x2019;s files. On most systems the dollar sign would then
            change to the pound sign <span class="strong">#</span> to indicate that care must be taken as you are in special privileges mode, often called <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/R/root.html">root</a>.

      <article>
        <div class="widget text" data-title="Warning">


                  <p>Now, when the Little Hacker Lady, logs into her dad&#x2019;s computer she makes it talk using the <strong>say</strong> command.</p>

                  <p>A command is a feature of the Operating System, using commands is a
                    management or administrative task, it is not really true programming,
                    but it is OK to call it that.</p>

                  <p>The say command uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis">speech synthesis</a>
                    to convert text to speech. The say command resides on her dad&#x2019;s
                    computer, and thus uses her dad&#x2019;s speaker. She executes the command at <a href="https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=310">5:10</a></p>

                  <p>The command she executes is wonderfully illustrative:</p>
                  <p><strong>say -v serena dad watch out</strong></p>



                  <p>You see that <span class="strong">-v</span> that&#x2019;s a special directive that states when executing the say command use the <span class="strong">v</span>oice of serena, serena is a
                    cute
                    name for a library of sounds, the say command supports multiple voices, serena is one of them.</p>

                  <p>How do people know that <span class="strong">-v</span> means voice, and how do they know that serena is one of the voices? <strong>Nobody knows this at first</strong>, before a person executes a command they
                    read
                    about it in a manual. The manual command is called <span class="strong">man</span> and people usually type <span class="strong">man</span> followed by the command-name that they want
                    to learn about. In this case: <span class="strong">man say</span>
                    (meaning bring up the manual page for the say command). The man page
                    will tell you how you can list all the available voices too (<span class="strong">say -v=?</span>), a command like <span class="strong">say</span> can do multiple things based on
                    what
                    you are trying to do. Here is the internet version of a man page for say: <a href="https://ss64.com/osx/say.html">https://ss64.com/osx/say.html</a></p>

                  <p>People are not happy with this. Many try to create simplified man pages, here is one example <a href="https://tldr.sh/">https://tldr.sh/</a> but it is always best to go to the source, and just get used to the man command.</p>

                  <p>She didn&#x2019;t need to use the serena voice library, she could have just executed:</p>
                  <p> <strong>say dad watch out </strong></p>



                  <p>And the say command would use the default voice. The say command is mostly available on Macs, Raspberry Pi will likely use the <span class="strong">espeak</span> command.</p>



                  <p> <strong>espeak &quot;dad watch out&quot; </strong></p>


                  <p>Espeak command is slightly different, for it gets confused by
                    multiple words, you have to join them together by wrapping them in
                    quotes. A programmer should demand that his program code has good
                    hygiene. eSpeak simply said &#x201C;I am not just going to read everything that
                    you type at me&#x201D; whereas the programmer that made the say command said
                    &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s just assume that whatever they throw at us needs to be converted
                    to speech unless something starts with a hyphen&#x201D;. The say command makes
                    assumptions, whereas espeak is very strict about input.</p>

            <article>
              <div class="widget text" data-title="The Kill -9">
                <p>At <a href="https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=229">3:49</a> the Little Lady Hacker explains that she will be shutting down her dad&#x2019;s code editor, and writes down the Process ID number <span class="strong">95251</span>. Mac users frequently use <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> code editor. She issues the <span class="strong">kill</span> command
                  with the <span class="strong">-9</span> switch, this is a terrible idea, as it basically crashes her dad&#x2019;s code editor and the <span class="strong">-9</span> ensures there is no way
                  to
                  save data. Here is the man page for the kill command <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/kill">https://linux.die.net/man/1/kill</a>.
                  Unix programs that are actively running are called processes (as in a
                  program that is processing something) and each process has a number.
                  The kill command can be used during development and debugging, in a
                  reboot scenario, or when battery is about to die on a laptop, it has its
                  proper uses. As a joke, it is already bad enough to use the kill
                  command on a process as it sends a TERM[inate] signal. As a programmer
                  you can add a signal handler in your program, and then in case of TERM
                  signal you can for example ask the user to save his data, the TERM
                  signal is an advisory. The -9 sends a KILL signal. There is no handler
                  for the KILL signal, there is no saving work, the process is destroyed
                  by the Operating System, whatever he was working on is lost. She
                  executes <span class="strong">kill -9 95251</span> at <a href="https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=326">5:26</a> his code editor disappears instantly. <strong>Yikes!</strong></p>

        <article>
          <div class="widget text" data-title="Jargon File">


            <p>There is a wee bit of jargon here, but don&#x2019;t worry. ESR is managing a jargon file you can read at <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/go01.html">http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/go01.html</a> and he has a cool <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">HOWTO</a> on hackers from which I quote below:</p>

            <p><strong>What Is a Hacker?</strong></p>

            <p>There is a community, a shared culture, of expert programmers and
                networking wizards that traces its history back through decades to the
                first time-sharing minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet experiments.
                The members of this culture originated the term &#x2018;hacker&#x2019;. Hackers built
                the Internet. Hackers made the Unix operating system what it is today.
                Hackers make the World Wide Web work. If you are part of this culture,
                if you have contributed to it and other people in it know who you are
                and call you a hacker, you&#x2019;re a hacker.</p>

            <p>The hacker mind-set is not confined to this software-hacker
                culture. There are people who apply the hacker attitude to other things,
                like electronics or music &#x2014; actually, you can find it at the highest
                levels of any science or art. Software hackers recognize these kindred
                spirits elsewhere and may call them &#x2018;hackers&#x2019; too &#x2014; and some claim that
                the hacker nature is really independent of the particular medium the
                hacker works in.</p>

            <p>There is another group of people who loudly call themselves
                hackers, but aren&#x2019;t. These are people (mainly adolescent males, and
                little girls) who get a kick out of breaking into computers and
                phreaking the phone system. Real hackers call these people &#x2018;crackers&#x2019;
                and want nothing to do with them. Real hackers mostly think crackers are
                lazy, irresponsible, and not very bright, and object that being able to
                break security doesn&#x2019;t make you a hacker any more than being able to
                hotwire cars makes you an automotive engineer. Unfortunately, many
                journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word &#x2018;hacker&#x2019; to
                describe crackers; this irritates real hackers no end.</p>

            <p>The basic difference is this: hackers build things, crackers break them.&#x201D;</p>
