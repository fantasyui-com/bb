          Don&apos;t aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target,
            the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot
            be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side
            effect of one&apos;s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or
            as the by-product of one&apos;s surrender to a person other than oneself.
            Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let
            it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your
            conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of
            your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long-run - in the
            long-run, I say! - success will follow you precisely because you had
            forgotten to think about it.

            Warrior is the oldest name for it.
            Since our days in Africa we have progressed forward and the word has evolved many times.
          </p>

          <p>
            At each stage there are strong lessons to be learned, directly, or indirectly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whatever your calling, wherever you break away to make your stand,
            even if you fail to reach the top of your mountain, know that you will
            surely reach the rays of the sun, know that you will become part of the
            Great Family of Heroes, know that countless many will follow, and that
            your footsteps will become a well worn path, in time.</p>

          <p>The lessons come from Philosophers, Scientists, Thinkers, Soldiers, Presidents, Athletes,
            Mercenaries, Murphy&#x2019;s Law, Mighty Little Girls &amp; Young Ladies,
            Mothers, Sisters, Brothers, and Fathers.
            From empathy and compassion, joy and tragedy, triumph and disaster,
            and great challenges like learning to live and grieve at the same time,
            or standing with the demonized, disposable, or voiceless.</p>

          <p>The lessons come from, Choosing Life.</p>

          <p>To progress forward, we must be ready to learn to understand by
            subtle analogy from all other theories. Theories of survival, of living
            above the common levels of life, of choosing heroism, choosing
            greatness. Striving to thrive, rising to impossible challenges, learning
            to overcome pain and suffering, and standing upon the shoulders of
            giants to lead the way for others to follow.</p>

          <p>Who includes diversity and is Nature,</p>
          <p>Who is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of</p>
          <p>the earth, and the great charity of the earth and the equilibrium also,</p>
          <p>Who has not look&#x2019;d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing, or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing,</p>
          <p>Who contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover,</p>
          <p>Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism, spiritualism, and of the &#xE6;sthetic or intellectual,</p>
          <p>Who having consider&#x2019;d the body finds all its organs and parts good,</p>
          <p>Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by subtle analogies all other theories,</p>
          <p>The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;</p>
          <p>Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in other globes with their suns and moons,</p>
          <p>Who, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day but for all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,</p>
          <p>The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together.</p>
