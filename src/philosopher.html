              (from Greek &#x3C6;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3C6;&#x3AF;&#x3B1;, philosophia, literally &#x201C;love of wisdom&#x201D;) is the
              study of general and fundamental questions about existence, knowledge,
              values, reason, mind, and language. Philosophia has been called The
              Mother of All Sciences.</p>

              Sir Ken Robinson, in his &#x201C;How to escape education&#x2019;s death valley&#x201D;
              states that the more successful Alternative Education Systems should
              become the norm, because they are clearly more successful.

            <p>I think that some day we maybe able to find great schools, and people
              like Sir Robinson will help that day come. But it will be too little
              too late, certainly for us.
              In this final chapter I will ask you to take Extreme Ownership of Your
              Education, and here is Jocko Willink explaining the gravity of the words
              Extreme Ownership.</p>

            <p>
              Extreme Ownership of Your Education, simply means <strong>Self Education</strong>.
              It means learning at your own pace, by your own means, in a sequence that matches you the best.
              This is also the meaning of the opening quote by Sun Tzu <em>&#x201C;Victorious warriors win first and then go to war,
              while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.&#x201D;</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              Education is not about GPA, diploma, or career. It is about growing
              up, it is about being healthy, and strong.
              Regardless of where you are headed, whether or not that direction
              includes Medical School, or a University. You need to Self Educate
              before sitting down in those classrooms. A classroom may not be the
              place where you find knowledge, not always, not reliably.
            </p>

              Setting off on an endless Audiobook Adventure, to last you many
              years, or even decades, is probably the most illustrative example I can
              fit in a sentence. Astra Taylor, the woman behind the unacceptable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enyG430I2nk">Zizek!</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zwmum5_ofU">Examined Life</a>, and now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHxRj9JWQMs">Democracy</a> further explains, and I think serves as an example of what it means to Self Educate.

              <p>
                The beginning of self education starts with a class of teachers often
                called Science Popularizers. They don&#x2019;t just teach science, but also
                restore the connecting lines between all the Daughters of Philosophia,
                lines lost due to the bleaching effect that categorization of knowledge,
                standardization of sequence of learning, and standardized testing
                causes.
              </p>

              <p>The Storytelling of Science is a good overview of who these teachers are, how they think, of their energy and class.</p>

                <p>Education is simply too important to be put in someone else&#x2019;s hands.
                  It is your mind, your life, your growing up, your own responsibility.
                  Above all, your body of knowledge has massive infuence over your private
                  decision-making, over your freedom of choice, over your freedom of
                  will.
                  Decision-making is one of the most sacred things in life, and only you
                  should have control over that.</p>

                <p>I urge you to forget the idea that you must be taught to learn.
                  I urge you to accept that great responsibility yourself.
                  You must take extreme ownership of your own Self Education.</p>
