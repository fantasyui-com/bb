          <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy">Philosophy</a>
            (from Greek &#x3C6;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3C6;&#x3AF;&#x3B1;, philosophia, literally &#x201C;love of wisdom&#x201D;) is the
            study of general and fundamental questions about existence, knowledge,
            values, reason, mind, and language. Philosophia has been called The
            Mother of All Sciences.</p>

          <p>Sir Ken Robinson, in his &#x201C;How to escape education&#x2019;s death valley&#x201D;
            states that the more successful Alternative Education Systems should
            become the norm, because they are clearly more successful.</p>

          <p><div class="widget youtube" data-id="wX78iKhInsc" data-title="How to escape education&apos;s death valley by Sir Ken Robinson"></div></p>



          <p>I think that some day we maybe able to find great schools, and people
            like Sir Robinson will help that day come. But it will be too little
            too late, certainly for us.
            In this final chapter I will ask you to take Extreme Ownership of Your
            Education, and here is Jocko Willink explaining the gravity of the words
            Extreme Ownership.</p>

          <p><div class="widget youtube" data-id="ljqra3BcqWM" data-title="Extreme Ownership by Jocko Willink"></div></p>



          <p>Extreme Ownership of Your Education, simply means <strong>Self Education</strong>. It means learning at your own pace, by your own means, in a sequence that matches you the best.
            This is also the meaning of the opening quote by Sun Tzu <em>&#x201C;Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.&#x201D;</em></p>

          <p>Education is not about GPA, diploma, or career. It is about growing
            up, it is about being healthy, and strong.
            Regardless of where you are headed, whether or not that direction
            includes Medical School, or a University. You need to Self Educate
            before sitting down in those classrooms. A classroom may not be the
            place where you find knowledge, not always, not reliably.</p>

          <p>Setting off on an endless Audiobook Adventure, to last you many
            years, or even decades, is probably the most illustrative example I can
            fit in a sentence. Astra Taylor, the woman behind the unacceptable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enyG430I2nk">Zizek!</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zwmum5_ofU">Examined Life</a>, and now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHxRj9JWQMs">Democracy</a> further explains, and I think serves as an example of what it means to Self Educate.</p>

          <p><div class="widget youtube" data-id="LwIyy1Fi-4Q" data-title="Astra Taylor on the Unschooled Life"></div></p>



          <p>The beginning of self education starts with a class of teachers often
            called Science Popularizers. They don&#x2019;t just teach science, but also
            restore the connecting lines between all the Daughters of Philosophia,
            lines lost due to the bleaching effect that categorization of knowledge,
            standardization of sequence of learning, and standardized testing
            causes.</p>

          <p>The Storytelling of Science is a good overview of who these teachers are, how they think, of their energy and class.</p>

          <p><div class="widget youtube" data-id="40YIIaF1qiw" data-title="The Great Debate: THE STORYTELLING OF SCIENCEi, part 2 of 2"></div></p>



          <p>Education is simply too important to be put in someone else&#x2019;s hands.
            It is your mind, your life, your growing up, your own responsibility.
            Above all, your body of knowledge has massive infuence over your private
            decision-making, over your freedom of choice, over your freedom of
            will.
            Decision-making is one of the most sacred things in life, and only you
            should have control over that.</p>

          <p>I urge you to forget the idea that you must be taught to learn.
            I urge you to accept that great responsibility yourself.
            You must take extreme ownership of your own Self Education.</p>
