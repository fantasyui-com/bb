          <p>We the warriors in pursuits of excellence, band together in sincerity and truth.</p>

          <p>May our philosophy be filled with power and may we connect in authenticity.</p>

          <p>May we strengthen and increase our admiration for honest dealing and
            clear thinking, and may our hatered of hypocrisy and pretence never
            diminish.</p>

          <p>May we inspire each other in our endeavor to live above the common levels of life.</p>

          <p>May we strengthen each other to choose the harder right instead of
            the easier wrong, and never to be content with a half truth even if the
            whole can&#x2019;t be won.</p>

          <p>May we endow each other with courage that is born of loyalty to all
            that is noble and worthy, that scorns to compromise with vice and
            injustice and knows no fear when truth and right are in jeopardy.</p>

          <p>May we guard each other against flippancy and irreverence in the sacred things of life.</p>

          <p>May we grant each other new ties of friendship and new opportunities for leadership or service.</p>

          <p>May we kindle our hearts in fellowship with those of a cheerful
            countenance, and soften our hearts with sympathy for those who sorrow
            and suffer.</p>

          <p>May we help each other to maintain Honor untarnished and unsullied
            and to show forth in our lives the ideals we learned in doing our duty.</p>

          <p>All of which we ask in the names of those before us, of those who stand today, and those who are yet to rise.</p>

          <p>Here, we come to today, the modern times. In the battle between the
            Gentleman and The Officer. The Gentleman was lost. The honor code is no
            longer aimed at Men, it is now aimed at cadets, aimed away from the
            public. It almost seems like growing up is optional, and things get very
            strange in deed:</p>

          <p><div class="widget youtube" data-id="85dhw7nulb4" data-title="West Point Pillow Fight Turns Violent"></div></p>



          <p>At times like these, where our greatest lessons are forgotten we must
            look back at where things got lost. At times like these the Knigtly
            Virtues ring again. As the poem says <em>The right can never die, If one
              man still recalls, The words are not forgot, If one voice speaks them
              clear, The code forever shines, If one heart holds it bright</em></p>

          <p>I think that one is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>
            I find it delightful that he chose not to be Knighted, he did not need
            to look back. Some call him the finest example of a Gentleman.</p>

          <p>His poem &#x201C;If&#x201D; is a magnificent reminder that growing up is not optional.</p>

          <p>Here is Sir Michael Caine reciting his poem (Click image to watch video).</p>

          <p><div class="widget youtube" data-id="EEFMVIfl2UY" data-title="IF, Rudyard Kipling&apos;s poem, recited by Sir Michael Caine"></div></p>

          <p><em>IF you can keep your head when all about you<br>
              Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br>
              If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
              But make allowance for their doubting too;<br>
              If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
              Or being lied about, don&#x2019;t deal in lies,<br>
              Or being hated, don&#x2019;t give way to hating,<br>
              And yet don&#x2019;t look too good, nor talk too wise:<br>
              If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;<br>
              If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;<br>
              If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
              And treat those two impostors just the same;<br>
              If you can bear to hear the truth you&#x2019;ve spoken<br>
              Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
              Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
              And stoop and build &#x2018;em up with worn-out tools:<br>
              If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
              And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
              And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
              And never breathe a word about your loss;<br>
              If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
              To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>
              And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
              Except the Will which says to them: &#x2018;Hold on!&#x2019;<br>
              If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
              Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,<br>
              if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
              If all men count with you, but none too much;<br>
              If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
              With sixty seconds&#x2019; worth of distance run,<br>
              Yours is the Earth and everything that&#x2019;s in it,<br>
              And - which is more - you&#x2019;ll be a Man, my son!</em><br></p>
