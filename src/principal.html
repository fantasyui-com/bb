                   <div class="widget text" data-title="Poverty Of Mind Comes From Lack Of Non Cognitive Skills">

                    <p>
                      Dan Cardinali's definition of Non Cognitive Skills includes the following: Building grit, and resilience, and persistence, and self-regulation. He's describing skills of a Warrior, a Fighter, an Authentic Grown Up.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                     Dan Cardinali explains that ideally families should provide Non Cognitive Skills (Child Development), and then schools will deliver Academic Development (Math, History, Physics).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      But this is not how it works today,
                      well to do parents are too busy,
                      parents stricken by poverty can't have time,
                      and non-cognitive skill development is not only unavailable, but is often laughed at by teachers "Parents do your job." they brainlessly utter.
                    </p>

                   <p>
                     Above all, a child born to the culture of poverty (lacking non-cognitive skills) will often remain in the culture of poverty be it dropping out or graduation.
                     The steps out and up are just too far apart.

                 <div class="widget text" data-title="The Battle Against Poverty of Mind">



                   <!-- <p>
                     Go against the grain of reality long enough, you will slam into the brick wall.
                     As far as Active Relevant Knowledge on subjects the children are passionate about, Audio Books are far better at teaching than any school.
                   </p> -->



                   <p>
                     It is correct to say that Poverty of Mind is rooted in lack of Non Cognitive Skills.
                   </p>

                   <p>

                     An example of poverty of mind is inability to have an expensive lunch with an internship company CEO.
                     Out of fear of not knowing <strong>EVERYTHING!</strong> from how to get a table to when to order, or even if it is OK to just have the cute little bagel and focus on the questionnaire.
                     Lunch, if not impossible, can be impossibly terrifying.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                     There is no breaking out of poverty when every-step induces fear, confusion, anxiety.
                   </p>


                    <p>
                      To be clear, the ultimate aim for both Student and Principal.
                      Almost always, is to rise and break away, become a CEO.
                    </p>

                    <p>

                      Become an inspiration and a teacher; to make life more.
                      To then retire come the Golden Age of Wisdom and write.
                      Write about the lessons that counted to make them last even longer.
                      Create an Audio Book in your own voice in hopes of it being used 50 years from now to Rise & Learn to Really Learn.
                      What an Honor to have your spirit revived by means of Admiration and Love, your own voice across decades, maybe centuries, maybe forever.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Instead, the children are getting scared, mostly because they can see schools are forcing irrelevant learning that fades away.
                      It is impossible to retain irrelevant knowledge.
                      In context of education, forcing irrelevant knowledge and grading a student down for lack of retention is evil.
                    </p>

                     <p>
                       And here the child does not want the job because it has too many complications,
                       can't even have the internship lunch because it is too terrifying,
                       and can't conceive of the notion of connecting with the CEO in such a way as to eventually resign position
                       and start a company in a similar sector.
                   </p>

                    <p>
                      They are scared, sometimes crushed, but far too brave to show you... Principal.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                     We know what happens to most young people that can't handle fear or depression.

                   </p>

                   <p>
                     A school must become a place of healing before it can hope to teach.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                     It must protect against all kinds of poverty, and bad parents, dangerous culture and bad ideas.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                     Today school is a bad place. Just another broken promise.

                    <p>
                      Never forget, Principal. You serve The Kids, The Students, they are the point of it all, they are the future.

                     The best way to fight poverty in a person's mind, is to set a student up for a job so high up,
                     that it will make them want to run out of the school quietly-yelling and hope they never need to come back.

                    <p>
                     Set a step so high, that it is already a healthy career but completely unreachable to the child, the step up being, Just Impossible.
                     And then slowly, build. But smaller steps, and maybe even smaller, or maybe even an on-ramp for a smooth ride.
