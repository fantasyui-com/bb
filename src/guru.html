              <div class="widget text" data-title="Recap and Summary">
                <p>
                  In The Wizard chapter we learned not to confuse the operating system,
                  with the user interface; as those are two separate kinds of computer programs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now we learn that UNIX is an operating system with a user interface classified as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">Command-line interface</a>,
                  and we separate the two and set UNIX aside, to see what else we can control with a command-line interface.
                </p>

            <article>
              <div class="widget text" data-title="The Command-Line Interface (CLI)">
                <p>
                  The command-line interface has proven it self to be very useful in context of UNIX,
                  and pretty much every other operating system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Let us set operating systems aside,
                  and ask some questions about the command-line interface as it relates to you,
                  Dear Reader.

              <div class="widget text" data-title="Uniformity of Commands">

                <p>
                  Once you learn the shape that a command can take, you will be able to use any command on any system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Let us proceed with an imaginary command "print" that has some extra features.

            <article>
              <div class="widget text" data-title="Command Documentation">
                <p>
                  Most well behaved commands can be executed with the --help argument, or the -h flag to print some helpful documentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <code class="text-green">print --help</code>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p class="small">
                  Popular commands will come with manual pages that can be read with the man command. In this case we would execute: <code class="text-green">man print</code>
                </p>

            </article>

            <article>
              <div class="widget text" data-title="The Simplest Form">
                <p>
                  In the following example there is one argument "hello world".
                  Without quotes the command would see two arguments "hello" and "world".
                  Quotes are used to join two or more things together.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <code class="text-green">print &quot;hello world&quot;</code>
                </p>
              </div>
            </article>

            <article>
              <div class="widget text" data-title="The Extended Form">
                <p>
                  In the next example we have a Boolean flag "-u" meaning enable underline mode.
                  To disable the underline mode, you simply remove the -u.
                  Then we have the extended argument "--format" followed by a directive "capitalize". Supported directives can be found in documentation.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <code class="text-green">print -u --format capitalize &quot;hello world&quot;</code>
                </p>

                <hr>
                <p>
                  To make things easier to type, most commands allow short form of extended arguments, so --format can become -f.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <code class="text-green">print -u -f capitalize &quot;hello world&quot;</code>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                  Conversely, most one letter arguments/flags have an extended form that begins with two hyphens. Note how -u changed to --underline.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <code class="text-green">print --underline -f capitalize &quot;hello world&quot;</code>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                  For clarity and readability, I recommend using extended forms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <code class="text-green">print --underline --format capitalize &quot;hello world&quot;</code>
                </p>

                <p>
                  Because of the uniformity of command syntax.
                  Once you know how to run one command, you know how to run them all.
                  You just need to pull up the documentation to see what all the commands are and what arguments they accept.

                <p>
                  Please read <a href="https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts">github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts</a>
                  Which "hack" this poor bastard's coffemaker, soon to be ruined romantic life, a particularly needy customer, and alcoholism. Based on a true story, apparently.

                </p>

                <p>

                  Please note how the community of geeks that love this story came together and started re-creating these "hacker" scripts in the programming languages they favor; probably out of sadness.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Here is the Node.js Version of <a href="https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/nodejs/fucking_coffee.js">fucking_coffee.js</a>.
                  Note that once the telnet connection is established at line number 22, we begin using the coffeemaker command-line interface: sys brew (line 26), sys pour (line 32).
                </p>

                <p>
                  Don't think of the coffeemaker as running UNIX,
                  just think of it as it being controlled by a command line interface somewhere.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Any machine with a button or two is a system with enough complexity to benefit from a command-line interface.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Note how you have never programmed a coffeemaker before, and yet you know precisely
                  - and may even remember for months to come - the commands "sys brew" and "sys pour".
                </p>

                <p>
                  <code class="text-green">sys brew</code><br>
                  <code class="text-green"> sys pour</code><br>
                </p>

                <p>
                  It seems sys is a single command that looks at the first text argument. Executing sys -h would probably print:
                </p>


<pre class="text-light"><small>
Coffemaker Help
----
-h / --help
  print this text

-v / --verbose
  print debugging information

-b / --brew / or simply brew
  start brewing

-p / --pour / or simply pour
  start pouring

-r / --reboot / or simply reboot
  reboot the system
...</small>
</pre>

<p>
  Lack of proper etiquette, and using text (brew) instead of arguments (--brew/-b) can be an indication of sys being a script that does not take the time to parse anything it just looks at the first thing after the command name. It is actually difficult to parse arguments (-b/--brew), it takes no effort at all to use raw text (brew).
