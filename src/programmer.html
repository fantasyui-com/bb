        <p>The $35 <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> is the most handsome in a class of computers called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer">Single-board computers</a>. They just released version 4,
          <strong>so make sure you get that one</strong>; and don’t forget a monitor. BestBuy does sell the PI, packaged in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rcNjgVgc-I">Raspberry Pi 4 Cana Kit</a>.
          Personally, I think getting the original keyboard and mouse is really
          cool, I am not a fan of the plastic case and would go for a cool looking
          <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VD568FB/ref=twister_B07VD58LGV?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Heat Sink “Case”</a> - and then probably short something out. Good news is that ashens has a two part review of all the popular cases here you go:
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTlB6oju5w">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYb2IEsfhnE">Part 2</a>. Heads up, ashens is an odd British man that utters odd British phrases.</p>

        <p>I would like to add, that there is a class of monitors called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=+Portable+Monitors">Portable Monitors</a>
          it is still nice to have a desk one, but if you are wondering which one
          to get; get a portable first (the cheapest one is $99), then you can
          take it to Starbucks, plug in your PI, keyboard and mouse, and
          headphones; and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qfa9hGJzoY">compose some music</a> with <a href="https://lmms.io/">LMMS</a> whilst <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mgrY-U9_8E">pondering album art</a> with <a

        <p>Also please don’t forget about <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=projectors">Projectors</a> as those too are a kind of monitor (the cheap ones are $50 - $75). A projector turns any

        <h4 id="part-2-system-breach">Part 2: System Breach</h4>

        <p>She likley stole her <del>daddy’s</del> dad’s password by using her older brother’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/keylogger/s?k=keylogger">key logger</a>.
          To log into her dad’s computer she uses the ssh command. ssh is just a
          program that establishes a secure (encrypted) connection between two
          computers. She executes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh alex@192.168.1.27</code> at <a href="https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=87">1:27</a>. And begins using the ssh program.</p>

        <p>The remote shell, for convenience sake, looks almost the same as her
          own local shell. Even though very little changes on her screen she is in
          a full-screen program now, and once she is authenticated her shell
          prompt changes to that of the remote system. It goes from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pi@calebpi ~ $</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[]~$[]</code>.</p>

        <p>A shell prompt is the thing that indicates that you are free to type
          commands. Her dad’s shell prompt is broken, he messed up with whatever
          was supposed to go in between those square brackets, it maybe that he is
          using fonts that the Raspberry PI does not have, or some mess like
          that. My prompt as I write this is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[user@computer warrior]$</code> that means username is user, my computer’s network name is computer, and the directory I am in is warrior.</p>

        <p>The dollar sign <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code>
          indicates that I, alex, and pi are normal users. You can escalate your
          system privileges to become a system administrator where you can read or
          delete other user’s files. On most systems the dollar sign would then
          change to the pound sign <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code> to indicate that care must be taken as you are in special privileges mode, often called <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/R/root.html">root</a>.

        <h4 id="part-3-the-warning">Part 3: The Warning</h4>

        <p>Now, when the Little Hacker Lady, logs into her dad’s computer she makes it talk using the <strong>say</strong> command.</p>

        <p>A command is a feature of the Operating System, using commands is a
          management or administrative task, it is not really true programming,
          but it is OK to call it that.</p>

        <p>The say command uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis">speech synthesis</a>
          to convert text to speech. The say command resides on her dad’s
          computer, and thus uses her dad’s speaker. She executes the command at <a href="https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=310">5:10</a></p>

        <p>The command she executes is wonderfully illustrative:</p>

        <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code>
      say <span class="nt">-v</span> serena dad watch out

      </code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>You see that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-v</code> that’s a special directive that states when executing the say command use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v</code>oice of serena, serena is a
          cute
          name for a library of sounds, the say command supports multiple voices, serena is one of them.</p>

        <p>How do people know that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-v</code> means voice, and how do they know that serena is one of the voices? <strong>Nobody knows this at first</strong>, before a person executes a command they
          read
          about it in a manual. The manual command is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">man</code> and people usually type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">man</code> followed by the command-name that they want
          to learn about. In this case: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">man say</code>
          (meaning bring up the manual page for the say command). The man page
          will tell you how you can list all the available voices too (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">say -v=?</code>), a command like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">say</code> can do multiple things based on
          what
          you are trying to do. Here is the internet version of a man page for say: <a href="https://ss64.com/osx/say.html">https://ss64.com/osx/say.html</a></p>

        <p>People are not happy with this. Many try to create simplified man pages, here is one example <a href="https://tldr.sh/">https://tldr.sh/</a> but it is always best to go to the source, and just get used to the man command.</p>

        <p>She didn’t need to use the serena voice library, she could have just executed:</p>

        <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code>
      say dad watch out

      </code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>And the say command would use the default voice. The say command is mostly available on Macs, Raspberry Pi will likely use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">espeak</code> command.</p>

        <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code>
      espeak <span class="s2">"dad watch out"</span>

      </code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Espeak command is slightly different, for it gets confused by
          multiple words, you have to join them together by wrapping them in
          quotes. A programmer should demand that his program code has good
          hygiene. eSpeak simply said “I am not just going to read everything that
          you type at me” whereas the programmer that made the say command said
          “Let’s just assume that whatever they throw at us needs to be converted
          to speech unless something starts with a hyphen”. The say command makes
          assumptions, whereas espeak is very strict about input.</p>

        <p>At <a href="https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=229">3:49</a> the Little Lady Hacker explains that she will be shutting down her dad’s code editor, and writes down the Process ID number <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">95251</code>. Mac users frequently use <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> code editor. She issues the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kill</code> command
          with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-9</code> switch, this is a terrible idea, as it basically crashes her dad’s code editor and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-9</code> ensures there is no way
          to
          save data. Here is the man page for the kill command <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/kill">https://linux.die.net/man/1/kill</a>.
          Unix programs that are actively running are called processes (as in a
          program that is processing something) and each process has a number.
          The kill command can be used during development and debugging, in a
          reboot scenario, or when battery is about to die on a laptop, it has its
          proper uses. As a joke, it is already bad enough to use the kill
          command on a process as it sends a TERM[inate] signal. As a programmer
          you can add a signal handler in your program, and then in case of TERM
          signal you can for example ask the user to save his data, the TERM
          signal is an advisory. The -9 sends a KILL signal. There is no handler
          for the KILL signal, there is no saving work, the process is destroyed
          by the Operating System, whatever he was working on is lost. She
          executes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kill -9 95251</code> at <a href="https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=326">5:26</a> his code editor disappears instantly. <strong>Yikes!</strong></p>

        <h4 id="jargon">Jargon</h4>

        <p>There is a wee bit of jargon here, but don’t worry. ESR is managing a jargon file you can read at <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/go01.html">http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/go01.html</a> and he has a cool <a
            href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">HOWTO</a> on hackers from which I quote below:</p>

        <p>“<strong>What Is a Hacker?</strong></p>

        <p><em>There is a community, a shared culture, of expert programmers and
            networking wizards that traces its history back through decades to the
            first time-sharing minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet experiments.
            The members of this culture originated the term ‘hacker’. Hackers built
            the Internet. Hackers made the Unix operating system what it is today.
            Hackers make the World Wide Web work. If you are part of this culture,
            if you have contributed to it and other people in it know who you are
            and call you a hacker, you’re a hacker.</em></p>

        <p><em>The hacker mind-set is not confined to this software-hacker
            culture. There are people who apply the hacker attitude to other things,
            like electronics or music — actually, you can find it at the highest
            levels of any science or art. Software hackers recognize these kindred
            spirits elsewhere and may call them ‘hackers’ too — and some claim that
            the hacker nature is really independent of the particular medium the
            hacker works in.</em></p>

        <p><em>There is another group of people who loudly call themselves
            hackers, but aren’t. These are people (mainly adolescent males, and
            little girls) who get a kick out of breaking into computers and
            phreaking the phone system. Real hackers call these people ‘crackers’
            and want nothing to do with them. Real hackers mostly think crackers are
            lazy, irresponsible, and not very bright, and object that being able to
            break security doesn’t make you a hacker any more than being able to
            hotwire cars makes you an automotive engineer. Unfortunately, many
            journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word ‘hacker’ to
            describe crackers; this irritates real hackers no end.</em></p>

        <p><em>The basic difference is this: hackers build things, crackers break them.”</em></p>

        <p><img class="img-fluid" src="images/glider.png" alt=""></p>

        <p>(This is a glider, a bit of a symbol for hackers, who are like cats,
          and do not like each other, heards, or stupid little symbols. The glider
          comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a> the little things manufactured by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_(cellular_automaton)">Gospers glider gun</a> and walking off
          towards lower right are gliders in action.)</p>

        <p><img class="img-fluid" src="images/gliders.gif" alt=""></p>

        <p>Gliders, are of the world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">Cellular Automaton</a>, you have heard Murray Gell-Mann talk about it in context of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONiWmzrmfuY">Emergence</a>
          the Game of Life is a little simulation of playing with Fundamental
          Principles, and Accidents. Life emerged the same way the gliders do, out
          of Complexity, Infinity of Time, Fundamental Principles, and Accidents
          (remember nobody counted the failed attempts).</p>

        <p>Here is Stephen Wolfram in his “Computing a theory of everything” TED talk, reminding us to <strong>never pause</strong> after uttering the words “I invented a new kind of science”, ugh.</p>

        <p>Originally, the beauty of commands was in being predictable,
          readable, and not causing surprises. UNIX style operating systems, are
          well thought out. But, people will cram a lot more than they should, and
          it gets out of control, here is a mild example of mixing some video
          files with the ffmpeg command: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ffmpeg -i test1.avi -i test2.avi -vcodec copy -acodec copy -vcodec copy -acodec copy test12.avi -newvideo -newaudio</code> which I hate; I have some guesses as
          to
          what the ff stands for. You can visit the man page here: <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/ffmpeg">https://linux.die.net/man/1/ffmpeg</a></p>

        </article>

        <article>

        <p>
          There is a feature in the command world, that can deal with high complexity, and that is the pipe.
          Meaning two commands can be connected by a pipe in the following manner:

          <div class="card border-success mb-3">
            <div class="card-body">
              <code>
                print "hello world" | uppercase
              </code>
            </div>
          </div>

          This which would result in changing all text to uppercase:

          <div class="card border-success mb-3">
            <div class="card-body">
              <samp>
                HELLO WORLD
              <samp>
            </div>
          </div>

          There is also a feature of pipes that creates files and that is the greater than symbol "&gt;".

          <div class="card border-success mb-3">
            <div class="card-body">
              <code>
                print "hello world" | uppercase &gt; greetings.txt
              </code>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>Instead of seeing "HELLO WORLD" on the screen we’d see it in the file named greetings.txt</p>

        <p>What do programmers actually do?</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4a7_HH9Wbg"><img class="img-fluid" src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/g4a7_HH9Wbg/0.jpg" alt="What do programmers actually do?"></a></p>

        <p>If you look really closely at a screen, especially an older color TV
          you will see that it is made up of little red green and blue dots like
          so:</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdWCUr1FDqU"><img class="img-fluid" src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/UdWCUr1FDqU/0.jpg" alt="Pixels"></a>
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR2dRWfr7m0"><img class="img-fluid" src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/DR2dRWfr7m0/0.jpg" alt="Pixels"></a></p>

        <p>(Click images to watch videos)</p>

        <p>Let us leap from screens to actual images, and talk about real pixels as they exist in an image, and not a monitor.</p>

        <p><a href="https://youtu.be/15aqFQQVBWU?t=44"><img class="img-fluid" src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/15aqFQQVBWU/0.jpg" alt="Real Pixels"></a></p>

        <p>It would be almost impossible to try to do something to pixels of an
          image with standard UNIX command line. This is generally achieved by
          downloading extra programs, namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageMagick">ImageMagick</a>. There are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager">package managers</a> that help the user to install programs with a
          simple command: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo apt-get install imagemagick</code></p>

        <p>Doing custom work that nobody has ever thought of before is possible
          by writing new commands. Writing new commands, programs, or apps, is the
          definition of Programming.</p>

        <p>To perform unique operations on pixels via commands, one would need to create supporting commands such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spaghettify</code> which would unravel an image into a line of colors, and
          corresponding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unspaghettify</code>
          the problem is that spaghettify and unspaghettify would not be able to
          communicate directly. If all we send between the two is pixels, then the
          information about the format of the image, the width and height would
          not transfer. We would need to tell unspaghettify about how to
          reconstitute the image:</p>

        <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code>
      spaghettify image.jpg
      | filter <span class="nt">-t</span> darken
      | unspaghettify <span class="nt">-w</span> 1024 <span class="nt">-h</span> 768
      <span class="o">&gt;</span> image-darkened.jpg

      </code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filter -t darken</code> would mean use filter of type darken, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unspaghettify -w 1024 -h 768</code> would mean that the width of
          the
          original image was 768x1024 pixels.</p>

        <p>Becasue of all those little extras that we have to think of, the UNIX
          command line is not a perfect candidate for uniquely controlling an
          array of little pixels in some artistic way. The best way to do it, is
          to use a programming language and confine everything to a single
          command.</p>

        <p>This way, we won’t need to remember widths and heights, or color
          modes and extended image information, and we can cram a lot more into
          the clockwork without making a mess. Rather than creating three commands
          (spaghettify, filter, unspaghettify) we’d end up creating one command.</p>

        <p>Here is a JavaScript example of getting at the raw color information of an image, it is taken from a tiny and dusty <a href="https://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> library called <a
            href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/get-image-data">get-image-data</a>
          rather than pipes to pass information around everything is wide open.
          Rather than being placed into separate commands that we have to keep
          interchangable and document with pages and pages of… manual pages - the
          red, green, blue, variables already contain numbers from 0 to 255, and
          one can do math with it.</p>

        <pre><code class="language-JavaScript">
      var image = require('get-image-data')

      image('./image.jpg', function (err, info) {

      var data = info.data
      var height = info.height
      var width = info.width

      for (var i = 0, l = data.length; i &lt; l; i += 4) {

      var red = data[i]
      var green = data[i + 1]
      var blue = data[i + 2]

      // do something mathematical with the colr variables
      // here we substract 50 from each of the colors
      red = red - 50;
      green = green - 50;
      blue = blue - 50;

      // make sure none of the values are less than zero
      // if the new value is less than zero, make it zero
      if(red &lt; 0) red = 0;
      if(green &lt; 0) green = 0;
      if(blue &lt; 0) blue = 0;

      // print it out as text (like in the video)
      console.log(`rgb(${red},${green},${blue})`)

      }

      })

      </code></pre>

        <p>Running this program would print out red, green, blue information about all the pixels in image.jpg, simlar to this:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code>
      rgb(225,23,76)
      rgb(0,153,36)
      rgb(235,73,56)
      rgb(72,0,116)
      ...
      </code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>This is what Dianna means when she talks about puzzles, you got all
          this color information, and you can mess with it, and then take the
          numbers and encode then as a jpg, or maybe you can make a movie, where
          you scramble the pixels on purpose to create what is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_art">Glitch Art</a>. Just about 100 lines of code, bunch of selfies, and you become an artist.</p>

        <p>Armed with Color Theory, RGB values, and a library like <a href="https://vis4.net/chromajs/">Chroma.js</a> and you are out on an expedition.</p>

        <p><strong>Please Note:</strong> <a href="https://vis4.net/chromajs/">Chroma.js</a> library has <strong>LIVE CODE EXAMPLES</strong> that you can play with, for example you can change the code in the first example from:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-JavaScript">
      chroma('pink').darken().saturate(2).hex()

      </code></pre>

        <p>to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">64, 224, 208</code> which is the Turquoise they use in the Pixel explanation video above, and play around with the colors and functions.</p>

        <pre><code class="language-JavaScript">
      chroma(64, 224, 208).darken().saturate(2).hex()

      </code></pre>
