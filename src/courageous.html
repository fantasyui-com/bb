            Relative to their beginnings,
            many will find just enough comfort and stop, and often block traffic.

          <p>
            If you rise in class.
            Your teachers will fight you, because they just want to do their job, go home, and get paid.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you rise in class.
            They will say you are disrupting the class and throw you out, because they just want you to shut up so they can finish their job and go watch some TV.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can talk to the Principal or Dean, but they'll just tag you as "Gifted" and you'll graduate from Adult Ed so fast you'll struggle to remember where it all started and what the battle was for.

          <p>
            The battle is for those that come; after you.
          </p>

          <p>
            In short term, you get a sweet sliver of solace as you learn that in the end all your troubles ended up counting towards protecting others from the same.
          </p>

          <p>
            In long term, you help the world grow, it won't be your world, it will be the world of the future.
          </p>

          <p>
            The battle for real education, and enjoying the fruits of real education are two separate things.
          </p>

          <p>
            It will make you tired.

            There are very few Alternate Education resources, and as you rise you realize that the Start-up Accelerator rates are extremely low, almost too low.

            Nothing, nothing is as sweet and easy as putting up with broken education, the broken rules, the status quo, staying in school, getting some "good" grades, making your parents happy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Nothing is as easy as forgetting all of that ever happened, and make up excuses after excuses, forgetting everyone and everything, and never looking back.

          <p>
            I went to  the woods because I wished to live deliberately,
            to front only the essential facts of life,
            and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.
          </p>

          <p>
            I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear;
            nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary.
          </p>

          <p>
            I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,
            to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life,
            to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms...

            Real Education, is not about getting really educated.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is about Your Life, Dignity, Authenticity, Health.
          </p>

          <p>
            Life that revolves around sweet and easy and making everyone else happy is not a healthy life.

                            "... it was clear that the teachers were forcing us to memorize for long enough to pass standardized testing,
                            so that they could get paid,
                            so that the school could get funding,
                            so that everyone would keep their jobs..."

                            We expected to be held back, and eventually kicked out. We didn't expect to be seen as the gifted ones."

                          <p>
                            "... Staying in school had a negative impact on our education, on our futures. College and Premed brought sleep deprivation into the farce, it was a dangerous joke."

                          <p>

                          <p>
                            In the absence of teachers, we became the teachers.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            To quote an an old commercial: We were The Crazy Ones, The Misfits, The Rebels, The Troublemakers,
                            the round pegs in the square holes,
                            the ones who saw things differently,
                            who were not fond of rules,
                            and had no respect for the status quo.

                          <p>
                            We were the ones crazy enough to think we could change the world...
