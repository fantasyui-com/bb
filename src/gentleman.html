         <p>There is no force in the universe that can help a person grow up
           outside in. In education, the idea of dividing all subjects into tidy
           categories that make perfect sense takes away from beauty of Knowledge.
           Coupled with the misunderstanding that we can be taught by being talked
           at, school can only become an exercise in memorization. A school may
           make a diploma, but it cannot make a grownup.</p>

      <div class="widget text" data-title="Authenticity">
        <p>Gentlemen emerged from Knights, inheriting the philosophies of
          Knightly Virtues. I am sure every fool, wealthy or poor, tried to call
          him self a gentleman, but I think back then people paid attention to
          such claims.</p>
          <p>The ease with which we accept lies from people of authority today. Would not be present had the virtues still mattered to an overwhelming majority.</p>

     <div class="widget text" data-title="Definition">

       <p>My definition of a Lady/Gentlelady, or a Gentleman: A person ennobled by her deeds.</p>
       <p>More specifically, the <em>sum of intent across a person's entire history.</em></p>

       <p>
         The one lesson that I loved in High School.
         A Gentleman, an English Teacher reminding us: "The choices you make today, dictate the life ahead of you.".
       </p>

       <p>
         And it is those same choices, that will describe who you really are, come a decade or two from now.
         Therefore, choose wholeheartedly, beautifully, heroically, always rising and growing up.
         Make the choices that the older you won't regret.

       <p>
         Life is the single most complex adventure you will face, take the long roads.
         Choose Books, Audiobooks, and inherit as much wisdom from all the great beings as you can.
         I personally recommend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_Philosophy">The Story of Philosophy, The Lives and Opinions of the Greater Philosophers</a> by Will Durant, especially the <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Story-of-Philosophy-Audiobook/B0044EQEIA">Audiobook version</a>.
