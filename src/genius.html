            Genius, is a collector, and a master of frameworks.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of the most pop frameworks, is English.
          </p>

          <p>
            The "Double U", the 26 unsqiglies (as I call them - my original alphabet has extra squiggly letters I never knew what to do with). And then the comma and, Oxford Comma, the mysterious semicolon, the haunting tilde?
          </p>

          <p>Rhymes.</p>
          <p>Poems.</p>
          <p>Songs.</p>
          <p>Letters.</p>
          <p>Essays.</p>

          <p>
            Transcribing Lyrics, of a song that paused your time, classes, grades, parents?
          </p>

          <p>
            Memorizing Poems?
          </p>

          <p>
            Quotes? To thine own... yeah you did.
          </p>

          <p>
            Speaking. Reading. Writing.

            You have the tools, persuasiveness, nonchalance, warping facts to construct fantasy with mighty Ice Giants, maybe Dragons, to easily pass on a message across centuries.

            My friends, the story of Grendles Modor remains unfinished, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idis_(Germanic)">Ides</a> Aglæcwif of Ælwihta Eard; beacons her side to be writ. Was Grendles Modor a monster, would she be an Ide then?

            Pick up the pen. Rebuild the story a thousand times, and let the version 1001 earn you a place in history.

          <p>
            Genius, is to answer the challenge. Ælwihta Eard, is the world of our childhood stories, from Baba Jaga, to The One Ring, to Harry Potter, and beyond.
          </p>

          <p>
            Genius is to pick up the pen, and not fear sounding foolish.

            When I was learning English, my most powerful piece of literature was The Conscience of a Hacker, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_Manifesto">The Hacker Manifesto.</a> (See External Links section for Hacker's Manifesto at Phrack Magazine)
          </p>

          <p>
            I am wiser now, the text is for a teenager. But I feel no shame for still holding it dear to my heart. I am glad to share with you.

          <p>
            Because storytelling, inspiration, sharing of wisdom, is just a part of The English Framework for Human Communication - that you mastered without noticing... as a child.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the age of 15 or earlier, you master a framework almost as complex as any of the more interesting Daughters of Philosophy (The Sciences).
          </p>

          <p>
            It comes to you so naturally, that you don't notice it.
          </p>

          <p>
            You think we are born with the ability for language.
          </p>

          <p>
            But, no.
          </p>

          <p>
            And not only do you learn it, your brain grows to match the complexity of information needed to manipulate it.
          </p>

      </article>







      <article>
        <div class="widget text" data-title="Genius, like Child Prodigy, is just a stepping stone. Don't stop.">

          <p>
            You are to surpass what you think Genius is, on your way up, to growing all the way up.
          </p>

          <p>
            This act of transcendence will recur several times, depending how busy you get in life.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some things you think are one-way today (High School, Roswell, Globalization, Content of Character, Memorable Words, Superstars, and/or Reptilians) will change meaning, as you grow; possibly/hopefully even reverse.
            Similar to how "We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals." turns around, as we learn that Criminal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phreaking">Phreaking</a> is just not worth the prison time.
          </p>

          <p>
            My Dear, Friends, Readers. Your disbelief, in my unpersuasive arguments, is already all the proof.
          </p>

          <p>
            You have easily mastered something only a genius child prodigy could.
          </p>

          <p>
            Didn't even notice it, English came so naturally, so simply - didn't it?
          </p>

          <p>
            ... and you say you are not a Genius?

            Uh huh.

            Let me show you how Frameworks emerge.

        <div class="widget text" data-title="Good Frameworks come with Easy On-boarding">

          <p>
            Easy On-boarding means easy access to eventual mastery. It means progressive, gradual learning and mastery.
          </p>

          <p>
            It would be difficult, though not impossible, to learn to write words without knowing the alphabet.
            English, or as I call it here "The English Framework for Advanced Human to Human Communication" bonds really well with our ability to learn words as a baby.
            The language evolved with human learning abilities. If English words were presented without letters, it would still be a functional, but very different language.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fundamentally, a framework without easy on-boarding, or progressive adaptation features is kind of useless.
            If there is no way to learn something, it won't be learned.

        <div class="widget text" data-title="Memorizing πr2">

          <p>
            Do you remember memorizing πr2?
          </p>

          <p>
            Memorization of πr2 should be a crime. That is the same as being threatened to learn English words without using the alphabet.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some young lady out there, tears in eyes can't comprehend πr2, and her mind rejects memorization, she NEEDS to know - tears in eyes - why is the r is squared? Her mind reaching for why is the r multiplied by it self. Is there a geometric square somehow?
          </p>

          <p>
            Warm, but not warm enough.
          </p>

          <p>
            A brilliant mind yearning for arriving at the formula her self, yet forced to merely blindly accepting it, or repeating the whole year.
          </p>

          <p>
            People who need to invent the formulas, people who have the natural predisposition for abstract theoretical mathematics... The naturally predisposed for abstract mechanics or Mathematics, are being forced, not to, learn Mathematics, or be punished.

        <div class="widget text" data-title="Just eyeball that the base is half the circumference.">

          <p>
            Did you catch it, it does not matter how many divisions of the circle.
            Just call them infinite. Because with enough divisions you can already see, with your own eyes, that the base of the rectangle is half the circumference of the circle.
          </p>

        <p>
          Armed with this knowledge, the young lady from example above can arrive at her own πr2, when needed.
        </p>

        <p>
          And mc2, and all the rest.

          <p>
            It was only ever intimidating because it is an primitive language, with an ugly problem:
            As <a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">Math as Code</a> notes "Mathematical symbols can mean different things depending on the author,
            context and the field of study (linear algebra, set theory, etc)."
          </p>

          <p>
            The Alphabet of Math, is basic programming.
