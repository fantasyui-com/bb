            The widespread urban legend that one swallows a high number of
            spiders during sleep in one's life has no basis in reality. A
            sleeping person causes all kinds of noise and vibrations by
            breathing, the beating heart, snoring etc. all of which warn spiders
            of danger.

            Article adjustment on eyewitness report. Loftus' meta-analysis on
            language manipulation studies suggested the phenomenon effects
            taking hold on the recall process and products of the human memory.
            Even the smallest adjustment in a question, such as the article
            preceding the supposed memory, could alter the responses. For
            example, having asked someone if they'd seen "the" stop sign, rather
            than "a" stop sign, provided the respondent with a presupposition
            that there was a stop sign in the scene. This presupposition
            increased the number of people responding that they had indeed seen
            the stop sign.

        <div class="widget text" data-title="False Etymologies of English Words">
          <p>
            The actual origin of the phrase "the whole nine yards" is a mystery,
            and nearly all claimed explanations are easily proven false.
            Incorrect explanations include the length of machine gun belts, the
            capacity of concrete mixers (in cubic yards), various types of
            fabric, and many other explanations. All are probably false, since
            most rely on nine yards when evidence suggests that the phrase began
            as "the whole six yards". In addition, the phrase has appeared in
            print as early as 1907, while many explanations require a much later
            origin date.

        <div class="widget text" data-title="English Usage Misconceptions">
          <p>
            Misconception: The words "and" and "but" must not begin a sentence. Those who
            impose this rule on themselves are following a modern English "rule" that was
            not used historically. Jeremy Butterfield described this perceived prohibition
            as one of "the folk commandments of English usage". The Chicago Manual of Style
            says:

            There is a widespread belief—one with no historical or
            grammatical foundation—that it is an error to begin a sentence
            with a conjunction such as 'and', 'but', or 'so'. In fact, a
            substantial percentage (often as many as 10 percent) of the
            sentences in first-rate writing begin with conjunctions. It has
            been so for centuries, and even the most conservative
            grammarians have followed this practice.
