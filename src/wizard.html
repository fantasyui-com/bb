            In the fantastic video below you will learn about the old User Interface to the UNIX Operating System: The Command Line Interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            UNIX, Linux, Windows, Commodore. Can each be divided in two simple layers, the underlying Operating System (OS), and the front-facing User Interface (UI).

            You should not confuse the Operating System, with the User Interface; as those are two separate kinds of computer programs.
            An Operating System, can have many types of User Interfaces.

              For Example. The designers of my first computer, The Commodore 64. Decided that the best interface for a little computer is an editor of a programming language. Not a Command Line, not a Graphic User Interface, but a kind of a line editor (a precursor to a text editor) that edits the lines of a computer program that then can be ran.

              The Android based Phone, is actually a Graphical User Interface to an underlying Linux Operating System.
              It is possible to prevent the loading of the Android Graphic User Interface, and end up in the underlying Linux Command Line Interface (CLI). You can then connect a USB keyboard to your phone, and type commands at it using the CLI.

        <div class="widget text" data-title="Simplicity Lost">
          <p>
            Originally, the beauty of commands was in being predictable,
              readable, and not causing surprises. UNIX style operating systems, are
              well thought out. But, people will cram a lot more than they should, and
              it gets out of control, here is a mild example of mixing some video
              files with the ffmpeg command.
             </p>
             <p>
               <code class="text-dark">ffmpeg -i test1.avi -i test2.avi -vcodec copy -acodec copy -vcodec copy -acodec copy test12.avi -newvideo -newaudio</code>
             </p>
             <p>
               I have some guesses as to what the ff stands for. You can visit the man page here: <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/ffmpeg">https://linux.die.net/man/1/ffmpeg</a>

        <div class="widget text" data-title="Pipes">

          <p>
            There is a feature in the command world, that can deal with high complexity, and that is the pipe.
            Meaning two commands can be connected by a pipe in the following manner
          </p>

          <p>
                  <code class="text-dark">print &quot;hello world&quot; | uppercase</code>
          </p>

          <p>
            This which would result in changing all text to uppercase, and printing it on the screen.
          </p>

          <p>
            <code class="text-dark">HELLO WORLD</code>
          </p>


        </div>
      </article>

      <article>
        <div class="widget text" data-title="Redirects">

          <p>
            There is also a feature of pipes that creates files and that is the greater than symbol &quot;&gt;&quot;.
          </p>

          <p>
                  <code class="text-dark">print &quot;hello world&quot; | uppercase &gt; greetings.txt</code>
          </p>

          <p>
            This which would result in changing all text to uppercase:
          </p>

          <p>
            Instead of seeing &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot; on the screen we&#x2019;d see it in the file named greetings.txt
          </p>

        <div class="widget text" data-title="User Interface">
          <p>
            While Pipes and Redirects of the Command Line are often enough. A number of Graphical Pipe Editors exists as well.
