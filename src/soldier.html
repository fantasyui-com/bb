                    taught in Athens from about 300 BC. Based on the moral ideas of the
                    Cynics, Stoicism laid great emphasis on goodness and peace of mind

                  <p>According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness

                    itself, by not allowing oneself to be controlled by whim, the desire for
                    pleasure, or fear of pain, by using one&#x2019;s mind to understand the world
                    and to do one&#x2019;s part in nature&#x2019;s plan, and by working together and

                1157 - 1247) was especially beautiful, with white skin, long hair, and
                charming features. She was also a remarkably strong archer, and as a
                swordswoman she was a warrior worth a thousand, ready to confront a
                demon or a god, mounted or on foot. She handled unbroken horses with
                superb skill; she rode unscathed down perilous descents. Whenever a
                battle was imminent, Yoshinaka sent her out as his first captain,
                equipped with strong armor, an oversized sword, and a mighty bow; and
                she performed more deeds of valor than any of his other warriors.</p>

            Where a Hunter had to be a hunter or perish, becoming a soldier was almost optional.
            A soldier needed training, skill and wisdom to survive into retirement.
            A soldier, also needed a tribe as not to live in isolation.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is in the wisdom of warriors returning from hell of war, that we find hard earned inspiration and strength;
            because there isn't a soldier that does not ask "Why am I in hell?".
          </p>


          <p>
            One of the most important lessons to take away from this, is that a soldier is saved inside out, not outside in.

          A truly brave man is ever serene; he is never taken by surprise;
            nothing ruffles the equanimity of his spirit. In the heat of battle he
            remains cool; in the midst of catastrophes he keeps level his mind.
            Earthquakes do not shake him, he laughs at storms. We admire him as
            truly great, who, in the menacing presence of danger or death, retains
            his self-possession; who, for instance, can compose a poem under
            impending peril or hum a strain in the face of death. Such indulgence
            betraying no tremor in the writing or in the voice, is taken as an
            infallible index of a large nature - of what we call a capacious mind,
            which, far from being pressed or crowded, has always room for something
            more.

        <div class="widget poem" data-title="Eight virtues of Bushido">

          <h5>Righteousness</h5>
          <p>Be acutely honest throughout your dealings
            with all people. Believe in justice, not from other people, but from
            yourself. To the true warrior, all points of view are deeply considered
            regarding honesty, justice and integrity. Warriors make a full
            commitment to their decisions.</p>

          <h5>Heroic Courage</h5>
          <p>Hiding like a turtle in a shell is not
            living at all. A true warrior must have heroic courage. It is absolutely
            risky. It is living life completely, fully and wonderfully. Heroic
            courage is not blind. It is intelligent and strong.</p>

          <h5>Benevolence, Compassion</h5>
          <p>Through intense training and hard
            work the true warrior becomes quick and strong. They are not as most
            people. They develop a power that must be used for good. They have
            compassion. They help their fellow men at every opportunity. If an
            opportunity does not arise, they go out of their way to find one.</p>

          <h5>Respect</h5>
          <p>True warriors have no reason to be cruel. They do
            not need to prove their strength. Warriors are not only respected for
            their strength in battle, but also by their dealings with others. The
            true strength of a warrior becomes apparent during difficult times.</p>

          <h5>Integrity</h5>
          <p>When warriors say that they will perform an
            action, it is as good as done. Nothing will stop them from completing
            what they say they will do. They do not have to &#x2018;give their word&#x2019;. They
            do not have to &#x2018;promise&#x2019;. Speaking and doing are the same action.</p>

          <h5>Honour</h5>
          <p>Warriors have only one judge of honor and character,
            and this is themselves. Decisions they make and how these decisions are
            carried out are a reflection of whom they truly are. You cannot hide
            from yourself.</p>

          <h5>Duty and Loyalty</h5>
          <p>Warriors are responsible for everything
            that they have done and everything that they have said, and all of the
            consequences that follow. They are immensely loyal to all of those in
            their care. To everyone that they are responsible for, they remain
            fiercely true.</p>

          <h5>Self-Control</h5>
          <p>Warriors feel more than others. This calmness
            of behavior and composure of mind is rooted in the choice of endurance
            without a groan, wisdom over ignorance, understanding over
            confrontation, love over anger, and unbreakability in the face of
            suffering and loneliness.</p>

              To help a family, you build a library, a school,
              a free university, you open borders, and give them aid.

            <p>

            <p>Police in Chicago are calling for tougher sentencing, the gangs are

            </p>

              <p>And one of the
              lessons we learn from this text is that "A human being is more than the
              worst thing they have ever done."
            </p>

            <p>
              There is a class of soldier that is a product of their environment.
              Some are an emergent property of poverty.
              Maximization of survival, leads to the emergence of a self taught soldier.
