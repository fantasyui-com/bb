					Don't aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target,
					the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot
					be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side
					effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or
					as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself.
					Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let
					it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your
					conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of
					your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long-run - in the
					long-run, I say! - success will follow you precisely because you had
					forgotten to think about it.

					Since our days in Africa we have progressed forward and the word has evolved many times.`,

					`At each stage there are strong lessons to be learned, directly, or indirectly.`,

					`Whatever your calling, wherever you break away to make your stand,
           even if you fail to reach the top of your mountain, know that you will
					 surely reach the rays of the sun, know that you will become part of the
					 Great Family of Heroes, know that countless many will follow, and that
					 your footsteps will become a well worn path, in time.`,

          `The lessons come from Philosophers, Scientists, Thinkers, Soldiers, Presidents, Athletes,
					 Mercenaries, Murphy's Law, Mighty Little Girls and Young Ladies,
					 Mothers, Sisters, Brothers, and Fathers.
					 From empathy and compassion, joy and tragedy, triumph and disaster,
					 and great challenges like learning to live and grieve at the same time,
					 or standing with the demonized, disposable, or voiceless.`,

					`The lessons come from, Choosing Life.`,

					`To progress forward, we must be ready to learn to understand by
						subtle analogy from all other theories. Theories of survival, of living
						above the common levels of life, of choosing heroism, choosing
						greatness. Striving to thrive, rising to impossible challenges, learning
						to overcome pain and suffering, and standing upon the shoulders of
						giants to lead the way for others to follow.`,
