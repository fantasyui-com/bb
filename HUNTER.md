This artwork has been with me for as long as I can remember, I found it in a book entitled "Wszechświat życie człowiek" (Universe, Life, Human) and one of my favorite writers Bill Bryson wrote something just as good [A Short History of Nearly Everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything) which is available as an [Audiobook](https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Short-History-of-Nearly-Everything-Audiobook/B002V0KFPW) where he gently talks about learning, and what he learned about our universe.

We grew up protecting each other, casting out those who stand in the way of future generations, looking after the little ones so that they may grow to become great hunters.
